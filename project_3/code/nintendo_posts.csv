"i’m 50/50 on it. i like the simplicity of mario kart as it is. however, the track potential by expanding into nintendo’s other ip is to great of an idea to throw away entirely. and i feel like mario kart 8 deluxe is the magnum opus of the mario kart series. where do they even go from here? 100 courses can’t be topped. plus they’re adding more DLC characters as well.

in my opinion, they need to keep the name mario kart have it be a majority of mario characters. and then they could add some of nintendo’s all-stars into the roster. Link, Zelda, Pikachu, Kirby, Samus, Captain Falcon, Fox, Inkling, Villager, Ness. and that’s it. i don’t think we need Sonic or Pac-Man or Mega Man because this is still mario kart. not smash. just 10 of nintendo’s most iconic characters and then have rest be entirely the mario cast.",do you think mario kart should evolve into nintendo kart?,11a53w0

Ok so I actually wanna ask something: are the paper Mario games post TTYD really as bad as people seem to universally make them out to be? The general consensus regarding the Paper Mario series is that any games after TTYD (except for the wii game which I believe has mixed feelings from the community) are bad. But is this true?

 * ***Randnet Disk*** was released in 2000 for the 64DD in Japan. Software that allows the user to access the internet through *Randnet*. Randnet Disk functioned as a web browser. The player would be able to surf the general internet, read and post to message boards, swap high scores and game data, use email, and swap messages with game programmers and producers. There was also an avatar system, similar to what was in *Mario Artist: Talent Studio*, which it had released alongside.

   
   
 * ***Mario Artist: Talent Studio*** was released in 2000 for the 64DD in Japan. In this art utility, developed by *Nintendo EAD*, the aim is to create your own characters and place them into short films that you can share over the Randnet DD service. Create polygonal characters using the editing features, and insert yourself into the film by taking a picture of your face by using a digital camera or even the Game Boy Camera. You can change a character's colour, shape and outfit. You can alter aspects of the film you create as well.

   
   
 * ***SimCity 64*** was released in 2000 for the 64DD in Japan. In this city-building simulation, developed by *HAL Laboratory*, you are the mayor of a new city. Lay down the foundations for residential, commercial and industrial districts, then connect them with transport, power and facilities and watch as your city grows. You can earn money through taxation, allowing you to keep your town in order. At the end of each year you can raise taxes to increase your funds or lower them to keep your citizens happy.

   
   
 * ***Baten Kaitos Origins*** was released in 2006 for the Nintendo GameCube in Japan. In this role-playing game, developed by *Monolith Soft*, twenty years prior to the events of *Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean*, younger versions of many characters from the prior entry feature, though none of the same playable characters. The overall theme is that of a struggle between ""pro-magnation"" (the power of hearts, wings of the heart, and magic) and ""pro-machination"" (mechanical) forces.

   
   
 * A fifteenth wave of ***Super Smash Bros. amiibo Figures*** was released in 2016 in North America and included *Mega Man - Gold Edition*.

"I adore mii characters, I love their design and they hold a special place in my heart. However, I think I know why people don’t like the miis in nintendo switch sports and stuff.

We’re all used to the blocky and SD feel of the Wii, since it was quite an underpowered console. Then on the 3DS, that wasn’t near SD either, and that console supported miis like no other!

This was the golden age of mii characters.

When the Wii U came along, and nintendo stepped into HD gaming, they still supported miis incredibly well, but no one really knows that besides nintendo gamers since the wii u was such a commercial failure.

When nintendo didn’t take advantage of miis on the switch, besides user interfaces, everyone was understandably a bit upset. Then on nintendo switch sports, the focus was sports mates instead and people didn’t like that either. But the people that liked the sports mates didn’t like the miis, but why?

The miis look very weird in HD, they have such smooth faces and they look too overworked in character design. They don’t look the same as in the wii and 3DS. I love that idea but some people don’t and I understand why.

The solution? I think it’s nearing the time to put miis to rest since the modern era of nintendo is appending right before our eyes.

I love miis with all my heart, but I can’t see nintendo taking advantage of them ever again.

"What are, in your opinion, Nintendo’s 4 main franchises? Like, if you had to have 4 of their franchises serve as the mascots for the entire company, which would you pick? Though they are franchises, I ask that we exclude Smash Bros. and Mario Kart from discussion for this post since I’m focusing more on original franchises with their own set of unique characters. 2nd party franchises like Pokémon are okay though. As long as the franchises are owned/partially owned by Nintendo, they count. Things to consider: popularity, sales, other forms of media (spin-offs, apps, merchandise, TV shows, etc.), how often new games come out, and how long the franchise has been relevant.

In my opinion, Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Pokémon are 100% on this list.

As for the 4th one, this could be tricky. It’s really up to opinion, but I’ve got to give it to Kirby. This franchise has always had a consistent amount of attention given to it since it was first created. The sales for this franchise aren’t game-changing, but the games always have a decent amount of sales and new games come out at a frequent pace. Kirby also had its own TV show adaptation that was actually pretty mainstream and was rivaled only by Pokémon for Nintendo animes. Aside from all that, characters like Kirby, Meta Knight and King Dedede are just very iconic in general.

I considered Donkey Kong, Metroid, Animal Crossing, and Splatoon, but Kirby ultimately beat them for me. I excluded Donkey Kong and Metroid because the frequencies at which new games come out for these franchises aren’t very high. Animal Crossing and Splatoon were close, because the average sales per game are definitely higher than Kirby’s. However, I gave it to Kirby because it gets content more frequently and because it has more brand recognition. It’s also been out longer.

Even more so now that decades later Nintendo is popping up with their own theme parks.  That would never fly today.

The *Famicom Disk System* briefly served as an enabling technology for the creation of a new wave of home console video games and a new type of video game experience, mostly due to tripling the size of cheap game storage compared to affordable cartridge ROMs, and by storing gamers' progress within their vast new adventures. These games include the open world design and enduring series launches of *The Legend of Zelda* (1986) and *Metroid* (1986), with its launch game *Zelda* considered to be one of the greatest games of all time due mostly to its expansiveness.

"Y'all, two NEW Wii U games just hit the eShop on Thursday last week.  Silver Falls: Undertakers is a port of the 3DS game of the same name but with a new 5 player asymmetrical local multiplayer (think ZombiU but with five players instead of two).  Silver Falls: White Inside Its Umbra is a totally new survival horror game that really shows off what made the Wii U great and unique.  It uses the balance board, Gamepad, AND Wiimote/Nunchuck for control, and it has a single player story mode as well as a really robust four player co-op multiplayer mode.  They're a TON of fun and great swan songs for the Wii U.  Make sure you check them out, and if you like them, check out the 3DS games (3 Down Stars, Undertakers, Ghoul Busters, and Guardians and Metal Exterminators) and the Switch games (Ghoul Busters and Episode Prelude).

"While the NES and SNES have most of the big hitters (though not everything I'd want), the four newer consoles (GB, GBA, Genesis, and N64) are still a bit newer and have a lot of potential for good games to add on. What games in particular would you like to see on them?

Speaking just for myself:

**NES:** There isn't a lot on the NES service that's missing imo? I mean, sure, you could never go wrong with the Mega Mans and Castlevanias of the age, but I think the biggest missing one would be Duck Hunt. Literally just make it Wii style and use the Joycons' gyro controls, easy enough. 

**SNES:** The SNES also has a lot of its heavy hitters already present. Again, Mega Man X's, Castlevanias, etc, never hurts. My biggest issue is the lack of RPGs. Most of them are third party so I get it, but... the SNES is home to some of the best. Super Mario RPG and Chrono Trigger are my biggest wishlist items. Super Street Fighter II and Super Bomberman are also up there.

**Genesis:** I mean, come on. Sonic. Obviously this is a bit of a tough call to make given Sonic Origins existing and the other legal issues, but I would *love* to see Sonic 3 and Knuckles on there. Maybe Michael Jackson's Moonwalker? Again, also Super Street Fighter II. Ironically, besides the lack of Sonic, the Genesis set is a lot more diverse than some of Nintendo's offerings here. Sega does, I guess.

**N64:** The N64... really didn't have that many big titles to call its own, did it? Even still, there's some big ones missing. Smash 64 being missing is an obvious one, but there's also stuff like Banjo Tooie and hopefully the rest of Rare's catalogue, Mario Party 3, the Pokemon Stadium games... if I could make a wish though, I'd go for the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games.

**GB:** Now, I've never really been that big on the GB's library, to be honest, but there's still some good potential here. The rest of the Wario Land games spring to mind first, but there's also DK '94, Mario's Picross (bias lol), the Kirby games... oh, and that one monster game with the balls. Don't remember what it's called. Something about February 27th?

**GBA:** This is where a lot of my knowledge comes in. It's too early to say what Nintendo's plans are for the GBA offerings, but I've got quite a few I'd like to see. Metroid Zero Mission, the Pokemon games, Zelda Four Swords, the rest of the Super Mario Advance games, Wario Land 4, Kirby Nightmare In Dreamland, WarioWare Twisted (please), Mario vs. Donkey Kong, maybe even Mother 3... lots to ask for here, and I really really hope Nintendo delivers.

"This may seem a bit crazy and/or stupid, but hear me out.

Given the news of Microsoft's new contract with Nintendo and CoD, it got me thinking.  Nintendo will need a new powerful hardware to run the latest AAA games.

Nintendo and Apple have been working together for several years now, first with getting Super Mario Run on the App Store.  The mobile company that helped Nintendo get Mario on the iPhone; DeNa, is now forming a partnership with Nintendo under a new company, Nintendo Systems Co., Ltd which opens in April 2023

https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/11/08/nintendo-teaming-up-to-make-more-games-for-iphone/amp/


The similarities in the business models are well documented;

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-01-24/nintendo-switch-longevity-shows-parallels-with-apple

Apple has also been rumored to be making a Switch competitor, but they're well aware of how hard it is to break into the 3 team console race without established 1st party games.

https://www.imore.com/heres-why-apple-wont-release-nintendo-switch-style-hybrid-console

What if, and it's a massive if, the two companies combine forces to get a high end console onto the market that would allow Nintendo to reach the major AAA games market, and Apple to develop their first piece of dedicated gaming hardware since the Pippin

Nintendo has already shown a willingness to extend their software IPs outside of their homegrown hardware division.  This move would allow Nintendo to outsource high end hardware development, while still maintaining a lead on the mobile games market, sort of how they managed with the DS.  The marketing of a mutual platform would be equally beneficial

"I’m an aging Nintendo fan who has paid for my fair share of nostalgia remasters or re-releases and been disappointed by many. But when they announced the Gameboy collections I started to get really excited. I scanned the list of games and there it was: Wario Land 3, a title that surely heralds the subsequent masterpiece: Wario Land 4, the first video game I ever beat.

As a young child in the late 90s, video games were changing fast but many of them were not easy. I only ever played them at my friend Jacob’s house who had an N64. Even in coop I don’t think I ever won, but I was too young to know or care. By my next birthday I was begging for a console of my own and I got it: the chunky but ergonomic Gameboy advance. The first game I had was The Lion King game and it was too damn hard. The precision platforming skills that some of these games required was more than my kid brain could accomplish; I don’t know if I ever beat the first few levels. Then, that same year GBA came out, the 5th game with the greedy and possibly evil protagonist was released: Wario Land 4. 

Wario Land 4 drops any prior storyline and follows Wario into a strange Ziggurat/pyramid structure deep in a jungle. There are four themed sections of the pyramid with sequential levels that each lead to a boss. However the 4 sections can be tackled non-linearly. In each level, you attempt to reach the end where you grab a key bird, flip a switch, and trigger a countdown prompting you to get back to the beginning of the level as soon as possible. What’s really interesting about this is that the levels often change dramatically as the time ticks down, and you must contend with new obstacles, like a ghost who steals the key, or a route which turned to lava. 

The boss battles in this game really left such a lasting mark in my brain. There’s a Little Shop of Horrors plant boss, a crazy bird stuck in a cuckoo clock, a big inflatable teddy bear, and a weird bat/cat thing. Then of course the incredible last Diva boss that tested my child-coordination skills like no other. When I first took down the final boss in this game it was my first victory ever in a video game. And I loved the narrative I was rewarded with at the end of the game. There’s a time limit to the final boss, and if you are slow, Wario gets less treasure and the rescued princess at the end actually looks hilariously different (in order of fastest completion to slowest: “Sexy” princess, Cute princess, Wario mustachioed princess, child princess). As a kid this was all the motivation I needed. I played it again. And again. I essentially committed it to memory. Wario Land 4, the first game I ever beat 20 times. 

WL4 is so rich with color and zaniness matched with incredible level design that still stands up to modern 2D platformers. Wario’s sense of momentum and transformations fit so well to the themes and design of these awesome levels. On top of that, the score is as rich as the environments it is attached to. Even now I can remember the bee level, or the pinball level, the lava/ice level, or the magic carpet level. This Wario game has some really strange ideas, some of which have made their way into later Mario platformers but some have only existed in the beautiful, weird, cult classic. The game has personality and replayability which stands up to the test of time in a way that few games from that era have. The inventive style did not return in the last Wario land game which didn’t come until the Wii and was focused more on Wiimote motion control than platforming. Luckily Wario continued on as a protagonist in the mini game style games, which themselves have an arc, but that’s for another day…

I can only hope that WL4 makes the next round of games in the GB releases. I’ve always loved the side of Mario universe that was a little dark or weird or backwards and it comes from my love of Wario and the uniqueness that comes from (some of) his games. To anyone who has never played WL4, oh I envy you!  Wario Land 4, the first game I ever *loved*.",An Ode to Wario Land 4,1176m11

"The main thing you’ll need is two applications from the 3DS eShop: 1) Pokemon Bank and 2) Poke Transporter. Both are free to download, but one requires a subscription fee to take advantage of its features.

First before you do anything, make sure you own at least one of the Bank-compatible 3DS games, those being the Gen 6 titles and the Alola games. Next make sure you own at least one of the Transporter-compatible games, those being the Gen 5 games on DS and the Virtual Console versions of Gen 1 and 2.

You can download Pokemon Bank for free directly from the 3DS eShop, but you can’t do that for Poke Transporter. After downloading Bank, put the 3DS game in the cartridge slot (not necessary for digital owners) and open up the app. You will be prompted to pay the $5 monthly subscription fee to access Bank’s features, so make sure you transferred enough funds to your 3DS either through your Switch or your MyNintendo account via an internet browser. Please make sure it’s the same account across both platforms too.

Once you pay the fee, you can then use the link provided to download Poke Transporter. It’s hosted from the 3DS eShop and it’s a free download that fortunately does not require a separate subscription fee. Make sure you also have one of the Transporter-compatible games mentioned earlier, either physically in the cartridge slot (for Gen 5) or digitally on your system (for Virtual Console). And now that you have both 3DS apps, you can transfer all your Pokemon from them to Home.

The Bank app will be going free by the end of March, so you won’t have to keep paying the monthly fee to use its services. But if you haven’t downloaded these two apps before that date then you’re screwed, so you also can’t just wait for Bank to go free if you want to use them.",Here is what you need in order to transfer your Pokemon out of 3DS (quick guide),116r8kj

"Other than being an admittedly biased fan of everything Donkey Kong, I think there are a variety of indicators that the iconic ape will finally be getting a new game soon - the first new DK entry in a decade (not counting Tropical Freeze on Switch which was just a port of the 2014 Wii U game).

Let me explain! Other than it having been a ridiculous amount of years passed without a game in one of Nintendo's most iconic IPs, **certain rumours and multimedia activities have a newfound focus on Donkey Kong**, which is unusual given how the franchise otherwise has been relegated to somewhat of a supporting series to Super Mario.

**Reasons why:**

1. The large focus on Donkey Kong (and friends) in the upcoming **Super Mario Bros. Movie** (2023)
2. The (confirmed) **new Donkey Kong area** coming as an expansion to the Super Nintendo World theme parks (2024 in Japan and 2025 in Hollywood)
3. The rumored **Donkey Kong standalone film** following his inclusion in the Mario movie (2024?)
4. In 2024 it will both be **a decade since DK's last game** and also the Donkey Kong Country ""sub-series"" **30th anniversary**
5. The simple fact that the Donkey Kong series **hasn't gotten yet its own entry on the incredibly successful Switch**, a system that otherwise has proven it can boost the sales monumentally of all Nintendo IPs (Metroid, Animal Crossing, Smash Bros, Legend of Zelda etc.)
6. And finally... The heavily rumored **new Donkey Kong Switch game being developed by Nintendo EDP Tokyo**, the developers of Super Mario Odyssey (2023-24?)

Anyhow I feel that all of this, even discounting the unconfirmed rumours, **indicates a level of momentum and respect given to the Donkey Kong franchise that we haven't seen since the 90s**. This must, in my humble DK fan opinion, lead to a long-awaited majestic return of DK, most likely on the Switch sometime in 2024.",A lot of signs point towards a new Donkey Kong game coming in the next year,1177rsj

"This topic came to me recently because I finished another playthrough of Metroid: Zero Mission and am now playing Metroid Samus Returns on 3DS.

The context is that I tend to feel bad about obliterating many of these little critter enemies in Metroid games because I see them more as natural wildlife in their habitat - essentially animals and a lot of them don't even seem predatory! They just react with their self-defence instincts to what they have to see as a very dangerous intruder in their ecosystem: Samus Aran.

Second good example are some of the ""enemies"" in Zelda games, e.g. the crabs in A Link to the Past or the ChuChu's (especially the version in Breath of the Wild).

In Super Mario games I sometimes feel bad for throwing/kicking the Koopa Troopa in its shell in a place where it will continuously bounce back and forth. I imagine how sickening that must feel... Compared to that a good quick fireball shot might be preferable?!

What are enemies that you might feel bad for defeating them? I would love to read some thoughts!

P.S. If you allow me to stray from Nintendo-specific for one last example, because it is so weird...

**What is Slamfest '99?**

Slamfest '99 was an official promotional event for the N64's *Super Smash Bros.* that took place in Las Vegas on April 24, 1999. It featured a real-life, staged wrestling match between costumed performers dressed as Mario, Pikachu, Yoshi, and DK, and was broadcasted live on Nintendo's website via RealPlayer. The costumes used were the same as those seen in the well-known [North American commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K783SDTBKmg) for the game.

Despite the live broadcast, and despite it being available to be rewatched in RealPlayer for several months afterward, no video footage of Slamfest '99 is known to survive anywhere on the modern-day internet - it's completely lost. With  little evidence of the event even occurring, it has languished in extreme obscurity for over two decades, even among hardcore Nintendo fans. Since May 2020, a group of fans and archivists from the Lost Media Wiki have been actively searching for the lost broadcast footage (of which I'm a member).

If you're interested in learning more, check out the [Slamfest '99 article on SmashWiki](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Super_Smash_Bros._Slamfest_%2799) for more details on the event, as well as [LSuperSonicQ's video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn5fiiUiV8sa3BNPv7VR2y-RL_VdwTrNa) that chronicle the ongoing search effort.

______

**Image Details**

These 31 new photographs were provided courtesy of Ed Espinoza, Slamfest '99's producer. They were scanned from his personal collection, and he was gracious enough to offer them to the search team to be shared around. Ed has previously been [interviewed by GameXplain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coa7gZdAUMM) to talk about his memories of Slamfest '99's production.

These photos reveal new details that had never been seen before in the search, such as the performers' rehearsals, the gameplay stations to preview Smash 64, the surrounding stage area and production equipment, clear images of the referee and announcer, and much more. Very few photographs of the event have surfaced previously, so acquiring a collection this large is substantial news.

**Can I help the search?**

Yes! If you have any video footage, images, or information surrounding Slamfest '99, we would be greatly interested to hear from you - please reach out to me (/u/bozo_ssb) here on Reddit, and I'll relay it to the rest of the search team.

Before anyone brings it up, we are already aware of a certain Youtuber who claims to possess footage of the event on an obscure video format. In addition to a history of producing troll content, they have not provided a shred of proof to back up their claims, and we will not be taking them seriously until they do so.

"If the Wii U had a built-in cartridge reader for DS/3DS games with native backwards compatibility, it may have sold better for the simple reasons that the DS is the #2 best selling console of all time (in hindsight, of course) and the gamepad+TV setup closely mirrors the DS style of play.

For anyone who bought DS titles on the Wii U eShop, the stylus on the gamepad worked remarkably well, mimicking the touchscreen on the bottom screen of the DS. This was also a popular time for 3D TVs, which could theoretically support 3DS titles with its 3D top screen (though not strictly required).

Granted, this may have cannibalized hardware sales of its contemporary handheld system (the 3DS), but the same argument could be made for the Super Game Boy.",Would the Wii U have sold better with DS/3DS backwards compatibility?,113r613

Some of you might say ""Well, that just means you have stick drift on your GC controller! HAH!"". 

In the OG game, if you hold down the right trigger which then allows you to free aim using the left stick (which btw is also available and easily tested using the classic control scheme), this registers as an input, and if you keep on holding the trigger down forever without inputing anything else, the camera will also never move.

"So i know Nintendo usually has a console out about every 5 years, give or take. But the Wii U did so poorly, that the Switch has a ton of success due to ports from Wii U games that no one bought because they didn't have the Wii U. the games were consistently great, but no one bought the console, possibly because of the confusion with the Wii U and the Wii being so similar in name, and people not knowing it was a new console. idk what the reason was, but clearly the games were great, but the console caused an issue.

so most of the Switch's success is due to the Wii U's games. which has given them time to spread out the Switch games over more time, because they already have so many games on there from the Wii U. they're milking it for all they can, including the online service.  

and nintendo has not been shy about saying that the games and the experience playing them come before graphic output from the console. so i don't think they'd rush out another console right now for better graphics when most of their games have not been concerned with looking like next gen console graphics for decades now. and especially when the Switch is still selling very well.

i'm sure they're working on the next console like crazy, but i think they realized with the porting of 5 years worth of Wii U games onto the switch AND making switch exclusive games, they realize they really got a good 10 years to get out of this console. maybe even more. 

and that's why i don't think we'll see another console from nintendo until at least ~2027",Why I don't think you should expect another Nintendo console until at least 2027,112f7xo

"With Game Boy/Color and Game Boy Advance coming to Switch Online I'm pretty sure we'll see Pokémon games at some point on Switch, the main reasons I think so are: 

&#x200B;

*  With the 3DS eShop ending next month and Gen 1/2 games being unavailable to the public, it would be the perfect time to add these games to the Switch library. 

&#x200B;

* Pokémon Stadium 1/2 still hasn't been released even though it was announced quite early, even GoldenEye 007 which was announced much later has already hit the Switch library, I think the reason they haven't been released yet is because the Pokémon Company is waiting for the Gen 1/2 games to arrive on Switch since the GB Tower is a very important point for Pokémon Stadium games and without this connectivity the games are boring and incomplete, Nintendo has shown that it does not intend to launch its retro games incompletely, this is seen with Super Mario Advance 4 which has the additional levels of the e-Reader accessory, Mario and Luigi: SuperStar Saga ( and Super Mario Advance 4 ) has rumble support and has already been confirmed with dataminer that gyro/motion controls also work on the emulator and that if they wanted even Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble would be playable on the Switch.

&#x200B;

* The Pokémon from the Game Boy games ( Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal ) already have their programmed data in Pokémon Home and in the most recent Pokémon games, they even appear with a small Game Boy icon to identify that they are originated from these games.

&#x200B;

With Pokémon Day coming up I think it's just a matter of time before we see the classic Pokémon games on Switch, the question is... are they going to be part of the Switch Online subscription or are they going to be released separately like the NES Fire Emblem ?

"Let me just preface this by saying I really like Splatoon 2 and I have over 1500 hours in it, but I didn’t even buy Splatoon 3. I borrowed a friends copy to play in this chocolate themed Splatfest but every time I play it, it feels so similar to 2. It seems like this time around they were just focusing on fixing a lot of little things but even just focusing on that, there are so many obvious things that they could have done but didn’t. 

To start, rotations should have been done away with, and they should let you play on more than 2 stages per “rotation.” My solution would be to have the option to picked which ranked mode you want to play available at all times. Once you pick one, then you’d have a voting system like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe online where everybody picks a stage and then the game randomly picks one out of what people picked.

Secondly I want to talk about Salmon Run. Salmon Run is by far my favorite mode in all of Splatoon and I think they actually did the best job at making this feel new compared to everything else in the game, but they could still take it further. Let us have endless Salmon Run that doesn’t end until we miss a quota or everyone dies, with the difficulty raising every round. Let us have a VS mode where two teams of 4 compete to see who can get more golden eggs. I also think the 2 new Salmon Run stages we got are very good but they should have brought back all the old stages from Splatoon 2 (except for Salmonid Smokeyard because that one sucked) Also why can we only play on 1 stage every rotation? It would have been cool to play on a different stage every time.

Lastly in terms of ranked modes, there should have definitely been a new one in the game at launch. My idea would be a mode that focuses on kills and the team that gets the most kills in 5 minutes wins. There isn’t a ranked mode that is just about shooting other people and this would be simple but effective. Also idk where else to put there but idk why ranked modes aren’t part of splatfests. Including them would make splatfests better.

Those are just my thoughts. Splatoon 3 is weird to me because it is a popular game that will be supported for years that came out during the later years of the Switch.  I would have been much more excited for it simply if they waited until the next console. They could have even made it a launch title. Oh well. I’ll be here waiting for Splatoon 4.",Splatoon 3 could be so much better,110kz93
"Nintendo Switch's success is thanks to 3 things, the concept, the games and the price. And while some games have problems on the switch, it didn't stopped the console from selling well. But it does make the wish of a revision from the general public grow bigger as time passes. But I bet it's not gonna be a crazy upgrade if it ever happens.

Even if games are gonna be upgraded, the price might get a bit out of hand if they're not careful with what they add, and the concept of a hybrid console would suffer as well since the battery life would get shorter if the console is too demanding.

Nintendo knows that, and I think that if they ever release a revision for Nintendo Switch, they would at best add 1080p on portable mode and 1440p on the TV, 6gb of ram at best, 128 gb of storage maximun, a little bit of sacrifice for the battery but nothing too crazy and the price would be $400 which is expensive but also payable, nothing crazy.

"If you've ever played a Game Boy, Game Boy Color or GBA game on an emulator before, you'll have noticed that the color palette is usually very harsh and bright. The black color is 100% black, the white color is 100% white, and everything in between is a very vibrant bright color.

However, the color pallete used for games on NSO looks exactly like how these games looked on the real systems, with muted color palettes that are more true to the real thing. Add on top of it the option to add a pixel grid look and you have something that looks very convincingly like a real Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance. The grid filter you can apply even seems to add a little bit of ghosting to make it look even more convincingly like the real deal.

It's clear that this muted color palette is how these games are **supposed to look**, and it's a shame that a lot of emulator developers don't realize this.

In comparison, NES and SNES games don't actually have a way they're ""supposed to look"", because they were made to be played on a vast variety of TV types, but every game for the Game Boy systems was made with the properties of LCDs of the time in mind.

"I recently made a post about a theory I had about how the Nintendo DS could be the next and last console added to the online service, and generally speaking, the responses I got said that the Wii U worked because of the gamepad but the Switch won't be able to emulate the Nintendo DS decently.  
That made me realize something, say what you want about the Wii U game library but the console itself allowed for lots of things and most of them were lost in the transition to the Nintendo Switch, but looking closely, the concept of Switch looks like an evolution of the concept of Wii U, and I though that maybe it's possible to combine both concepts without losing anything, but in order for you readers to understand me, I gotta briefly explain how the Wii U and the Nintendo Switch worked before explaining my concept of an ideal hybrid console, so please, bear with me a little bit.  
It's best to start with the Wii U: it had two fundamental pieces, the console itself which was designed to be stationary (aka a home console) and the Wii U gamepad (which was the main controller to showcase the Wii U functionalities). The games were executed in the console itself and the gamepad connected to the console via an exclusive frequency (which minimized the delay), but while you could leave the room where the console is located and play in other room of your house with the Wii U Gamepad, you couldn't get too far away of the console or else the gamepad wouldn't receive the signal of the console and thus it would be impossible to play from the gamepad. The gamepad can also be used as a second screen and it allowed a decent DS emulation.  
Now let's talk about Nintendo Switch: the two fundamental pieces this time are the console itself which was portable (unlike the wii u) and the dock (which was used to leave the console charging while displaying the image of the game on the TV). Like before, the games are executed in the console itself, but unlike the Wii U gamepad, the dock doesn't use microwave frequency to connect to the console, you put the console into the dock and that's it, I'm serious. Because there's one single screen, apparently it's impossible to emulate the DS in a decent way. Since the Nintendo Switch doesn't depend on the dock, you can take the console anywhere while still being able to use it while also playing the games you want on the go.  
Now that I explained the Wii U and Nintendo Switch, it's time to explain my concept for an ideal hybrid console combining the best of the other 2: the two fundamental pieces are going to be the console which is going to be portable (like the switch) but instead of a dock the second piece is going to be a signal receiver (with an hdmi port to connect it to the TV). As you might have guessed right now, this is very similar to remote play in other platforms, but it has some differences. The games are coming from the console itself but if the console is in near enough of the receiver then the game's image is going to be displayed on the TV as well via an exclusive microwave frequency. With this you could both play the games you want anywhere you like and also simulate a second screen similar to the Wii U with similar functions.  
I can already see comments saying things like ""What's the point of a receiver if this is basically remote play? Why not use any screen I want like the one in my computer?"" Well, since computers normally cannot get microwave frequency (at least not without an adapter) then the only way to execute remote play for those systems would be via WiFi, but if that happens then delay and lag would be unavoidable, so it's far from an ideal way. A receiver and microwave frequency is way better.  
But that's just my concept. What do you think about it? Do you have another concept you like more? Tell me in the replies down below cause I really want to hear your thoughts about this topic.",I like the concept of Nintendo Switch but sometimes I do wonder if it the idea of a hybrid console could've been executed better than it did.,10zy7qz

"Metroid Prime Remastered is such an insanely well-done remake. Runs smoothly, solid control options, looks amazing and perfectly captures the nostalgia of the original.  I was watching some early reviews on Hogwarts Legacy and I'm glad I punted on it for now. Between the complaints about enemy variety, performance and broken AI, and the reviews that seem to gloss over those issues entirely, I just knew that I'd be disappointed because Harry Potter is such an insanely high bar to get right for a game. I'll probably pick it up one day, but it sounded like yet another game that was released before it was fully baked and I'm done with that. 

I had forgotten how much fun a more linear, less open-world game can be when developers can put more time into creating lots of enemy variety, which so many newer games seem to overlook. It's obviously silly to directly compare a new 2023 title to a remake of a 21YO game, but this remake is one of the best games I've played in a really long time. It still has its flaws (I wish there was a harder mode), but it's a great reminder of what games used to be like before cosmetics, pay-to-win, weird social media nods, etc. And Nintendo priced it incredibly well.

"Obviously the timed release thing is pretty bad. No one will defend that.

Super Mario 3D All-Stars put three of the best Mario games ever into one collection. Two of the games had never been re-released before. The three games remained mostly unchanged, which is common for just about every compilation ever, and the only major alterations involved the new controllers. This is, and I'm being serious, objectively good.

But for some reason, people hate it for this. Some people wanted massive changes to Super Mario 64, even though this is meant to be a compilation including the original game. Many complainers also griped about the removal of some glitches used in speedruns (which isn't even a removal because it's based on the Japanese version which didn't have the glitches anyway), such as backwards longjumping up the stairs. Most of the people that complain about this aren't speedrunners, and speedrunners weren't going to be playing this over the original anyway. Nevertheless, this apparently ""took away everything fun about the game"". I've seen someone genuinely make that comment. Do these people just not know how compilations work or something?

Meanwhile, you have the new Metroid Prime Remastered. I love Metroid Prime, and it's a very pretty remaster. But it's super disappointing that it isn't the full trilogy, and instead is just the single game. The new Direct had news about several enhanced ports that are always bundled with sequels, but Prime, which was previously bundled with its sequels, is standing alone. What we have here is just a shiny port of a single GameCube game. Sure it has a couple good accessibility features, but it's still just a single game. A single game that is, besides the subjectively prettier graphics, exactly the same as its GameCube counterpart.

So what's with the hypocrisy? The same people that complained about Mario 64 being the same, except for glitches most people don't use, are praising the Metroid Prime remaster for simple existing, even though it's an expensive port. At least Mario 64 also included Sunshine and Galaxy. Was $60 too much for those three games? Maybe. But I think $40 is also too much for Metroid Prime. And if they eventually remaster Prime 2 and 3, that's cool. $120 for Metroid Prime Trilogy. Yeah, and you say 3D All-Stars was overpriced.

Personally, I don't care for single re-releases of classic games. I feel the exact same way about Link's Awakening and Skyward Sword. We're WAY past the point where these games need to be by themselves, and that's especially true for Metroid Prime. That's why 3D All-Stars doesn't deserve the criticism that it gets. It's a collection of three of the best Mario games ever. That's all it is, and it's all that it needs to be. Galaxy 2 would've been nice tho. But for what it is, it's perfectly fine.

Tl;dr - People hate the ports of three games never released together, but love the port of one game that was released with sequels. This is dumb.","Why did 3D All-Stars, a compilation of three amazing games, draw such ire while Metroid Prime Remastered is so praised?",10zruff

"Up until recently, I always believed that Nintendo added their retro games in a cloud server so that everyone that used their online service could play them, but recently I was told that the games are actually downloaded into the console vía updates.

That made me realize something, Nintendo has to keep in mind the Switch storage (32 gb, 64 in oled) and that's why it wasn't until recently that they released a game (TotK) that surpasses 16gb of storage (which might explain why the game is $10 more expensive since the game card holds 32 gb instead of 16 and the policy that Nintendo manages forces digital games to cost as much as physical games, which also explains why terraria was $50 dollars until the physical release stopped) and this affects the online service as well since ever since the gamecube (for home console devices) and the 3ds (for handhelds), it's weird to not find a first party game that takes at least 1gb of storage size, which means that in terms of what console would join the service next, there's only one option left if they want to help save storage.

The DS games, I wouldn't call them small, but very few games reached the maximun storage capacity which was 512mb (which you would need 2 games of that size in order to get 1gb), because cartridges were expensive and it was a portable device (meaning devs didn't get crazy with the ds).

I was initially worried about the dual-screen since the Nintendo Switch has only one screen but they could add that option the Wii U had which allowed for the two screens to be displayed in one screen.

The only problem that I think is unavoidable, is the same one that Pokemon Cafe has, that you're forced to use the console on portable mode since the TV mode lacks a touch screen, I hope Nintendo sells an add-on to fix that problem.

But those are my thoughts, please tell me down below in the replies: what do you think about this?",The Nintendo DS might be the next and also the last console to be added into the online service.,10za34t

"If you've taken a rudimentary economics course, you know that the market clearing price is determined by the intersection of consumers' willingness to pay (demand) and producers' capacity to sell (supply).

While cost-push inflation is certainly possible, game companies generally have low overhead, with nearly all its budget going to labor costs. Wage growth [has fallen short of CPI](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/why-salaries-in-the-united-states-dont-keep-up-with-inflation-.html) since interest rates started rising. So, whatever theoretical cost that publishers are ""passing on to the consumer"" should track lower than inflation.

Furthermore, the inflation argument seemingly ignores the entire price history of games. Nominally speaking, the MSRP of triple-A games has remained flat at $59.99 since at least the early 1990s, meaning that the price of games has actually decreased in real terms. There are many reasons for this, including:

1. Competing digital entertainment options for customers (e.g. streaming services, smartphone apps/games)
2. New development tools including automation
3. A larger talent base of game developers that has reduced the cost of skilled labor

Are any of these economic drivers any less relevant now than a few years ago? Perhaps #3 is *slightly* curtailed by wage growth. But anyone who applies a broad metric like CPI to explain a price increase of a Zelda game has a poor intuitive grasp of economics.

A far more plausible explanation is that Nintendo is merely opportunistic, and understands that a mid- to late-cycle Zelda game is likely to appeal more to hardcore fans, who exhibit greater willingness to pay. This is a form of third-degree [price discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination). We saw the exact same thing with Majora's Mask, which had an MSRP of $79.99 upon its release in October 2000. Yet, no one would cite that as an example of inflation.

There is nothing inherently wrong with this; it is simply market forces at play. But attributing the price increase to inflation is simply ignorant.

"I posted a project last week that allows you to use an original N64 controller via a Raspberry Pi Pico ($4 microcontroller) as a controller for the Switch.

" 

oh there is an OUTRAGE !!! an HAAAAAATREEEED towards Nintendo for DARING to increase the game price to 70 USD over 60 USD. and I feel like I am taking crazy pills because games USED TO COST 70 USD if not more when I was a kid, I paid 70 USD for Zelda Link to the past, Ocarina of time I also paid 70, 7O for Wind Waker and I even paid 80 hard earned Dollars for Majora's Mask.

yet people at like Kotaku claims $70 Tears Of The Kingdom is the first game to ever cost 70 USD from Nintendo LOL

Not only that I used to pay even more for games that I had to import like half my JRPG collection I had to import as they where not released where I grow up, so I paid like 100+ USD for games back in the 90s.

THAT IS WITHOUT COUNTING FOR INFLATION, with inflation a game for 70 USD should cost like 140 USD to today. So I paid like 200 USD for same games, yet people wanna boycott for Nintendo for increasing Zelda by 10 bucks? have you guys bought groceries this latest year?

So imagine me paying 110 USD for Legend of Mana back in like 1999 and how I really dont see its a big issue having to pay 10 more usd for an amazing game like Zelda where I know the DOLLAR PER HOUR value is massive.

That being said do the Zelda tears of kingdom collector's edition is overpriced, there they added like 30-50 more USD for no reason, way too much.

"I've seen a lot of discussion about Nintendo charging $70 for Tears of the Kingdom and wanted to raise a few points and essentially show that it's reasonable to expect to pay that much for a game in 2023.

1. Inflation: The simple reality is, your money is worth less than it used to be. Using this [inflation calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm) you can see that even looking at inflation from 2018 to now, $70 is a reasonable price to pay for something that was $60 in 2018. **$60 in 2018 = $70.88 now**.

2. This isn't the first time games have been $70. Look at [this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DS5_OlmVQAEsPRG.jpg&imgrefurl=https://twitter.com/VGArtAndTidbits/status/949836469744619520&tbnid=bVpwf8S5JCn8tM&vet=1&docid=rFxctqkORacdQM&w=884&h=1200&source=sh/x/im) catalogue of Nintendo 64 games. You'll see that both DK 64 and Perfect Dark were being sold for $69.99 in 1999! That's equivalent to $123.44 today!! Even ""expensive"" games today are ludicrously cheaper than they were years ago. For example [Ocarina of Time](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/524458319089222844/) was sold for $60, **$108.65 today**. Even SNES games like [Street Fighter 2 Alpha](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/n822tu/toys_r_us_super_nintendo_ad_circa_1996/) were $70 (**$130.99 today**), $60 for Donkey Kong Country III ($112.28), or just for Zelda comparison, $50 for [Link to the Past](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/huguesjohnsoncom-electronics-boutique-spring-1993-catalog--106116134942054622/) ($101.78 today).

3. Games cost more to produce. While prices have remained stagnant (ie decreasing accounting for inflation), production budgets have exploded. Games like Zelda could be made by a team of 25 in the 90s and that's simply no longer the case. Now you have 100s of staff working on games that have even longer development cycles. While I'll acknowledge that the popularity of games has led to selling games for lower prices being more feasible (just because more people playing games = more people buying games = more profit, even at a lower price point), this can only be true to a certain extent. Not to mention, because of increased production costs/values, you're getting more bang for your buck. Today you get beautifully crafted world that will take 100s of hours to explore vs a game that could be beat in a tenth of the time that you'd get 20 years ago.

4. Nintendo has [promised](https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-union-pay-raise-layoffs-pokemon-scarlet-1850082365) a 10% raise for its employees. In a time of record inflation and huge layoffs in the rest of the tech world, this is the sort of behavior that we should be happy to see from a corporation like Nintendo. Of course, those raises must be paid for somehow.

All in all, I get that it sucks to pay $70 bucks for a game when you're expecting it to be $60, and it sucks that video games, formerly seemingly free of inflation, are now being impacted by it. Despite this, it's totally reasonable to expect the price of games to increase as time goes on, and Nintendo or any other publisher is not ""price gouging"" or being ""evil"" by doing so.

TL;DR: Looking at inflation, production budgets of today, and even just raw price comparisons, video games have never been cheaper than they are right now.","Reminder: Even at $70, video games are cheaper than they've ever been.",10ybyix

"I've been wanting to play this game since reading about it in Nintendo Power in 2006 but I was unsure about the idea of motion controls so I ended up getting a 360 at the time but many years later I finally got a Wii U and a bunch of Wii games and this year i finally got around to playing Red Steel and I ended up enjoying it. I was actually surprised by how in-depth the story was, yeah it's a little bit cliched but it was engaging enough that I was able to look past that(I even got the good ending). The sword fights actually got easier as the game went along IMO as you learned all those new techniques, as soon as I learned the hammer move I pretty much relied on that to end up fights as it was way easier then trying to drain the enemies health. I personally didn't bother sparing any of the enemies in sword fights as I found I gained plenty of honor elsewhere. That first fight with Ryuichi(the one you aren't scripted to lose)ended up being the hardest one for me because without your fancy techniques it gets to be a real pain, my arm was tired by the time I was done with him.

I was also surprised by the variety in the levels, I particularly enjoyed the gaming district with that one crazy guy and his Saw-esque traps.

For a launch-title this is damn impressive, graphically it's not that great compared to other games of it's time but it does have nice destruction physics on occasion.

"Hi r/Nintendo!

I've put together a list of some of the potential things we might see in today's direct, as mentioned by various games media outlets, Reddit, YouTube, Twitter rumours etc.

Now - I'm not a moron, this is quite clearly just speculation, and just for fun.

I'm not delusional enough to think that even a quarter of these things will happen, but it's Direct season and the hype is real. Happy gaming folks.

# The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

The safest bet; lock it in. One of two things is going to happen here: either we get a decent amount of info on the game and a confirmation of release date, or – the announcement of a ToTK-dedicated Direct to air in the next couple of months. , perhaps even next week. I'm leaning heavily towards the latter. There’s also the potential for that leaked Zelda model OLED to be revealed - if it is indeed legit. 

# Mario

**New 2D Super Mario** – lots of chat about this. The movie is drumming up hype, and releasing a new game alongside it makes a lot of sense. Sounding likely. 

**New 3D Super Mario** – it’s been five and a half years since Odyssey. People have been asking for this for a while, but *surely* it makes more sense to have the next big 3D Mario release as a launch title alongside the next console, whenever that might be. Of course, I could be wrong, but I don’t see it lining up. Will be an awesome title to kick off the next generation. 

**New Mario Movie footage** – not long to go now. Quite possible we get another short trailer here.

**Super Mario Galaxy 2 port** – don’t think it’s going to happen, simply because it should have already happened. There’s always the potential though, and if this is going to be a Mario-heavy direct as I suspect, there’s a chance for this – not to mention the other legions of Mario games that haven’t yet made their way to the Switch. 

**New Mario Sports title** –  Confident on this. Golf was announced in Feb 2021 and Strikers in Feb 2022. Baseball (Sluggers) and basketball (Hoops) would be the frontrunners, but I’d also be curious to see a Mario take on ice hockey or American football. The dream would be a game that included all four sports, but that would take some effort, and that might be asking too much. Something seems likely though.

&#x200B;

# DLC

**Xenoblade Chronicles 3 DLC** – announcement of next wave is coming. Possibly today.

**Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC** – announcement of next wave is coming. Probably today.

**Splatoon 3 DLC** – announcement of expansion is coming. Probably today.

**Fire Emblem Engage** **DLC** \- announcement of next wave is coming. Maybe today.

**Super Mario Party DLC** – it’s been a while, but it’s certainly still possible. Cautiously optimistic here. 

**Pokemon Scarlet/Violet** **DLC** – it’s going to happen, but more likely it’ll be announced in a Pokemon Presents in the next few months. There’s also those rumours of Detective Pikachu 2.

# Nintendo Switch Online

**New N64 Titles** – there’s a handful of already confirmed games that are yet to be added to the service, and until they are, don’t expect any more announcements.

**New SNES Titles, namely Chrono Trigger / Super Mario RPG** – the two glaring omissions from the SNES on NSO library. Earthbound was announced during a direct, it’s certainly possible at least one of these games finally sees the light today.

**GameBoy / GameBoy Advance added to NSO** – we might finally be seeing this today. Lots of smoke here – another cause for cautious optimism.  

**GameCube added** \- very strong nope. Would be amazing though.

**NSO adds current-gen games** – pure speculation on my part here, but in a big year for GamePass and PlayStation’s PS+ service, Nintendo might feel pressured to add more value to their own online service by adding current-gen games monthly, even if they’re four/five/six years old. No evidence behind this, but it seems like a good idea to keep up with the competition. 

# Switch debuts

**New F-Zero** – can’t see it. Personally think that it would be much better suited to stronger hardware, but that’s an even bigger stretch. Little bit of chat about it but personally I don’t buy it.

**New Star Fox** – same as F-zero. I give them both less than a 5% chance of appearing. 

**New Donkey Kong**  – never any hard evidence, yet frustratingly gets brought up before every single Direct… because of course it should! It’s a sensible prediction! DK is one of Nintendo’s big boys – why hasn’t he had a new game in almost a decade?!? It’s not like they’ve retired the franchise!....Having said that, I’m smart enough to not let myself believe we’ll see a new DK game today. 

And having said \*that\*, I’m dumb enough to believe we \*will\* see a new DK game later in the year. (Seriously though, what’s going on with the big ape?)

**New Kid Icarus** – unlikely I think. Would be a nice surprise, and it’s not impossible, but really don’t think it’ll happen. 

**New Wario / Waluigi game** – one out of left field. Nintendo loves new IP, and the anti-Mario bros haven’t had their own big game to star in yet. This is an absolute guess, obviously, and extremely unlikely, but it would be nice to give them \*some\* sort of legacy on the Switch.  

**New Ice Climbers** – what? No. I mean, *yes please*, but no. I saw someone predict this. If it was you, reading this now - are you feeling okay?

# Remasters/Ports

**Metroid Prime HD** – anybody seen the clown makeup? Throw it over here please. Seriously though, the only glimmer of hope left is this not-that-crazy idea that Nintendo are waiting to showcase the remaster alongside the first Prime 4 trailer in order to drive up hype. I’ll believe it when I see it.That’s a lie, I already believe it #clowned

**Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition** \- one of the last Wii U games left. Unlikely at this point in time. 

**TLOZ: The Wind Waker + Twilight Princess** – no. would’ve already happened. Especially not now ith TOTK so close on the horizon. Would love to be wrong.

**Tomb Raider Collection** – possible.

**Tomodachi Life** – don’t see it happening. 

**Batman Arkham Trilogy** – was seemingly leaked quite a while ago by a ratings board. Seems very plausible. 

**Pikmin 1 & 2** – feel like it would’ve happened alongside the port of Pikmin 3 if it was ever going to. It’s possible that they come out in the leadup to 4, but I’m pretty cold on this. Still - wouldn’t be too crazy of an announcement.  

# Remakes

**Unconfirmed Fire Emblem remake** – been talk for years of an old FE being remade and most “insiders” seem to push the idea that the series fourth entry, Genealogy of the Holy War, is the one in line for a complete ground-up rework. It’s one of the few games in the series still locked to Japan and would be a huge release, but to announce this while Engage is this new and shiny would be super weird, even for Nintendo. 

(Interestingly, the person who leaked FE:E info and screenshots (which proved to be true) also claimed this remake was *also* happening, but despite all the smoke it’s just too unlikely. Any classic Fire Emblem remake would be fantastic but I can’t see it happening soon. Not this year, anyway. 

**Mother (anything**) – biggest ‘hint’ here is that the Earthbound plushies have gone back on sale. Other than that there’s nothing here. Would be cool, is possible - but still very unlikely.

**Baten Kaitos** – niche cult game but there’s been some stuff floating around that suggests a remake is on the cards. Who knows.

# Release Dates

**Outer Wilds** – two years since the announcement and we’ve heard nothing. If it’s coming, now would be a good time to let people know.

**Advance Wars 1+2 Boot Camp** – it’s there. It’s ready. SURELY they do a quick little trailer, announcing the game’s release as either a shadow drop post-Direct or coming within the next month or so.

**Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters** – release confirmed, just awaiting a date. Today seems as a good a time as any. 

**Hogwarts Legacy** – Switch version needs more time to cook; still, might get a window for this.

**Deltarune** – new chapters are on their way. Possible announcement.

# The Confirmed Heavy Hitters

**Metroid Prime 4**  – We know it exists, and that with each passing direct it becomes slightly more likely that it’ll show up. Hopes aren’t sky high but it’s certainly within the realms of possibility. 

**Pikmin 4** – got the little teaser last time, should see a bit more this time. The 2023 release window could mean May (as rumoured) or could mean December, so how much is shown now (if any) is up in the air, but it’ll very likely be in this Direct in some way, shape or form.

**Hollow Knight Silksong** – I actually feel pretty confident about this. Microsoft basically confirmed it would be out by June, and with only four months left when better to announce a release date? The hype train is probably too big for an Indie World direct, so I expect to see the long awaited reveal here.

**Hades 2** \- it's early, but there's a chance a Switch release is confirmed along with a release window. 

# Surprise Sequels

**Astral Chain 2** – AC did well enough commercially and critically to warrant a sequel, but with all the focus on Bayonetta as of late it seems pretty doubtful. Maybe one day? Would be a pretty cool announcement to come out nowhere though. 

**Arms 2** – the first game actually did pretty well for itself, and it's been years now. Is there enough life in the concept to expand the franchise further? I don't think so, but I'm usually wrong. 

**Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker 2:** Sleeper hit (although originally a Wii U game) that could very likely spawn another title. Don't rule it out.

**Ring Fit Adventure 2 / Ring Hero** – over 14 million units of RFA were sold, meaning there are over 14 million rings in people’s homes. That seems like enough for Nintendo’s creative team to put something together. Maybe a direct sequel that comes with a compact treadmill, maybe a rhythm game, maybe even a party game. Seems a waste to not have more uses for the ring! Unlikely, not impossible.

**Luigi's Mansion 4** – LM has done enough to cement itself as a solid Nintendo franchise going forward. LM4 is happening, it’s just a question of when. Seems unlikely to be coming now, but it’s one to keep in the back of your mind. Very small chance of a surprise reveal. 

**1-2 Switch 2 / 3-4 Switch** – another one that’s had some chat around it. I neither know nor care.

# The big shot in the dark

**TimeSplitters 4** – there’s a grainy photo of an office wall with characters on it that’s been floating around.  With that in mind, consider this 100% confirmed to be at the direct.

Seriously though I’d sacrifice (almost) everything else on this list for a glimpse of TS4.

# and of course...

**New Super Nintendo Switch Pro** – No... but OOOOO can you imagine?

"Every time a general direct comes around, I always see the complaints that it wasted too much time on smaller games.  But every direct we've had for a while now has followed this same format:

Cold Open: Brand new game.  First five minutes. (Sept 2022: Fire Emblem Engage)

5-7 minutes of Nintendo Switch Headlines.  Usually indie/3rd party stuff, maybe some DLC for 1st party games thrown in there.

New game reveal, or info on previously announced game.  Sometimes a major 3rd party exclusive (Sept 2022: Octopath 2)

10 more minutes of Nintendo Switch Headlines.

New game reveal, or info on previously announced game. (Sept 2022: Pikmin 4)

10 more minutes of Nintendo Switch Headlines.

Second to last thing is often a trailer of a first party game (Sept 2022: Kirby Return to Dreamland Deluxe)

The last announcement.  ""One last thing"".  Usually the biggest, most hype thing of the Direct.  (Sept 2022: Tears of the Kingdom title reveal and release date trailer)

"I was happy when they announced that both Gameboy (including Gameboy Color) and Gameboy Advance games would be added to Nintendo Switch Online, but when they announced Metroid Prime Remastered right after that announcement I realized that Link's Awakening DX was going to coexist with the remake of Link's Awakening on Nintendo Switch, and that created a question: What's the point? The remake is definitely the superior way to play Link's Awakening and yet they added the Gameboy Color version as well? Why? I think it generates more losses tham gains so it's not worth it.

I was able to understand Super Mario Advance 4 cause despite being Super Mario Bros 3 from Super Mario All Stars all over again, it includes the e reader levels and similar to Bowser's Fury, that's pretty much it's own game so most people would want to play that game for those levels alone, but with Link's Awakening, I don't know if it's different enough to justify playing an inferior version of the game.

But that's not the only question I had after watching that announcement, cause that also made me wonder if this was going to happen again in the future. For example Advance Wars appearing on the service despite having a remake released by the time that happens, I would not see a point for that.

And if more consoles are going to be added in the service, they we may also get Metroid Prime on a future Gamecube service even though a remaster just came out, Xenoblade 1 and Kirby Return to Dreamland on a future wii service even though they both got a remaster and a remake respectively, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl on a DS service despite having a remake on Nintendo Switch already, Miitopia on a 3DS service despite having a rerelease on Nintendo Switch already, and I don't think I need to give ANY example for the Wii U cause there's plenty already. I think my point is pretty clear.

I just don't understand why Link's Awakening DX needs to be on Nintendo Switch when we have the remake, and if Nintendo keeps doing things like that then I don't know how this will benefit the company at all, It may only cause a money loss cause I highly doubt that the gains would be that big.

I am going to go as far as to saying that this is the biggest thing Nintendo has ever done. Yes of course if they did this with a Mario or Zelda game it’d be crazier but again Metroid is not some little league game so this is a big deal in it’s self.

"2022 marked the 30th anniversary of the Kirby franchise, as the original Dream Land came out for the Game Boy in 1992. And in recent years, HAL Labs have been putting Nintendo to shame when it comes to celebrating their flagship franchise’s big milestones. Back on Wii we were treated to the sublime Kirby’s Dream Collection, which blew Mario and Zelda’s 25th anniversary offerings out of the water. And now history seems to repeat itself 10 years later, so let’s see what the pink puffball had to offer us for his 30th birthday:

**[Kirby and the Forgotten Land](https://youtu.be/H3LAkr0ANgw):** It’s been a long time coming, but Kirby has finally made the transition to 3D. Set in an unknown post-apocalyptic cityscape, this game was structured more like Mario 3D World than Odyssey. This was the beginning of what folks at HAL referred to as the “next phase” of the Kirby franchise, and the public response was euphoric. It sold over 5 million copies worldwide and even won Best Family Game at the Game Awards that year.

**[Kirby 64 The Crystal Shards](https://youtu.be/0VfAsbGvXrA):** Back in May, the pink puff’s N64 debut was released to subscribers of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. While this game was rendered with full 3D visuals, it was still a 2.5D platformer all things considered. The big difference between this and the rest of the series was that Kirby can fuse two different copy abilities into a single new one, something that was only barely revisited in later entries.

**[Kirby’s Dream Buffet](https://youtu.be/qOGQv0hJNJ8):** Well this was certainly unexpected. In the summer of 2022, Kirby got a new multiplayer focused game out of nowhere. And the goal was to eat as much food as you can and out-fat your opponents across a series of obstacle courses. There have been plenty of comparisons to Fall Guys, but unlike that game this one was a self contained release for $15 USD that only supports up to 4 players max.

**[Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe](https://youtu.be/zAQZY2UVcoQ):** I don’t think this was on anyone’s bingo card any more than Dream Buffet. The 2011 Wii hit Kirby’s Return to Dream Land, also known as Kirby’s Adventure Wii in Europe, is getting a full blown remaster on the Switch in only a few weeks! It’s certainly a much more ambitious remaster job than the basic touch-ups that Mario Galaxy and Skyward Sword got, as this one is actually getting brand new content. We can expect new copy abilities, new sub-games, and online play!

"I'll be blunt: between a general lack of games of my interest (I basically play only Nintendo games now.

What are some of y'all's thoughts on the Switch's UI and eShop?  


Personally, I think that the UI is nice and tidy, and I like how fast it is especially compared to the PS4's UI, but it could be improved to be more ""nintendo-y"" in the next nintendo console, like having home menu music and themes like the 3ds. I'm surprised that for 6 years the eShop has been dreadfully slow, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it I guess.

"**To cut to the chase; Chris Pratt's Mario is not *THE SUPER MARIO*, thus the different voice.**

My theory is that the actual Mario disappeared some time ago and now this random guy from Brooklyn with an M on his hat who happens to look like Mario stumbles into Mushroom Kingdom and has to take Mario's place as the hero. This is also why Chris's Mario looks slightly.... off. 

Peach seems to know that it's not the real Mario and she tries her best to keep that a secret from the citizens (For Morale) and now she has to train him in secret which is why we see the training sequence in the trailer with just Mario and Peach.

This theory is also heavily supported by the Donkey Kong fight scene in the second trailer. In the beginning of the scene Chris's Mario focuses and quietly says to himself the classic Mario line **""Let's-a-go""** as if he's trying to channel the actual Mario he's been told about by Peach.

We also never see any back-n-forth dialogue interaction between Mario and the other Mushroom Kingdom citizens. I'm guessing this is to hide the fact that they mistakenly think that he is the actual Mario.

Charles Martinet (Mario's voice from the games) has been confirmed to have lines in the movie, but when asked about it he was very secretive. My theory is that he is voicing the ACTUAL Super Mario when he is saved at the end of the movie. This is an excellent way to give fans what they want without destroying their ears with the constant over-the-top italian accent.

As for the interaction between Luigi and Bowser, it seems like Bowser is also aware that the new Mario Brothers are fake (Probably because he had a hand in capturing the original Brothers before his invasion) which is why he starts with **""Not sure if you know who I am""** Another theory is that Luigi is actually the real Luigi and Bowser is saying that line sarcastically. However the poster showing Luigi in Brooklyn with Mario sort of debunks this theory. Then again it could be a misdirection by the PR team. Point is, Luigi is a bit of a wildcard atm.

I'm just getting the vibe that all the dialogue that is shown in the trailer is just so perfectly and carefully selected to hide this plot twist from us. Thing is, if I was given a chance to make The Super Mario movie, I would do something really, *truly* special with the franchise (like what I theorized) instead of something.... boring and expected. They have one chance to make something unforgettable.

Anyway, with this theory in mind they can have a lot of fun, like including [""Mario's Missing!""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Is_Missing!) jokes as well as include stuff from Luigi's Mansion where Luigi has to save Mario from inside the painting.

"I just played through Super Mario Galaxy 2 again for the first time since its release, and I think it is criminally underrated among fans.

I say fans, not critics, because it's right next to SMG on the rating list. But I feel as if many fans either didn't play it, or claim that because it ""didn't have a story"" it's worse than the original. But I just have to vent. When, EVER, has a Mario game been about the story? Like, seriously? It's the exact same plot every time, who cares? Of any series in gaming, Super Mario has been about the gameplay. I think they finally decided to embrace that by creating essentially a non-story to focus fully on the level design. And I firmly believe the level design is the best of any 3D Mario game.

The motion controls are used perfectly - not overdone, but provides moments where you want to stand on feet and focus to complete a task. Bringing in Yoshi added so many hilarious, fun moments and new ways to push the platforming. And holy shit, the power-ups were used PERFECTLY throughout the course of the game. The creativity behind some of these levels were simply incredible.

I think the most important factor in making SMG2 a true improvement over the original and the games that have come since then is that unlike any other 3D Mario, it is honest-to-god fucking difficult. It sneaks up on you - certainly at the beginning as you're racking up countless 1UP mushrooms. But every time you quit the game you got back to four lives, and as the game goes on you realize that the developers had no fear in letting you die A LOT. I genuinely appreciated how hard some of the challenges are in the game, and I don't think we've had that level of difficulty in a Mario game since then. Case and point is The Perfect Run. Easily the hardest Star I've earned in any platformer.

Sorry, just had to get this off my chest. If you haven't played it yet - find a way to. It is platforming perfection and deserves its flowers.",Pay attention to Super Mario Galaxy 2,10tk6tv

"I see a lot of discussions online around physical vs. digital games, and I find it weird that people are still buying physical games. There are so many downsides to buying physical, here are some of the reasons I only buy digital:

* Buying physical means less money for Nintendo! Digital games are often full price and 100% of the sale goes to the publisher. If I could, I would setup my direct deposit to go to Nintendo's bank account lol
* Physical games are HEAVY! Have you tried picking up one of these or better yet using a multi-cart case? I'm a gamer, not an olympic athlete!
* No social pressures to lend out my games to friends/family. When I buy physical games, people always want to borrow my games. But with digital I don't need to worry about that!
* I'm very environmentally conscience and production of game cartridges has a detrimental effect on the Earth so I avoid those like the plague.

"I've been a fan of both American football and more sports games and so does my dad and my brother though myself when it comes to games like Madden for as long as I can remember. I'm more of a memorial sports fan, but it's a shame that there hasn't been a proper American football game on the switch. The last time we saw a Madden game on a Nintendo console was mad in 13 for the weed and we you which was released back in 2012 that's over a decade without a single Madden game on any of the Nintendo's consoles from the Wii u all the way up till the switch since 2012.

Not only is American football, a popular sport in the United States, but it's also gained a growing following in other countries such as the UK, Germany, Mexico and Japan. In fact, Japan has their own American football type leagues and play very similar games to American football and they've been doing this since the 1930s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_League

And with this, I think that a Mario sports game based on American football would do really well with the growing fan base of American football and the lack of an American football game than the Nintendo switch

So here is my concept for a super Mario American football game


Game play:

The game we can buy an elements of traditional American football games such as Madden and the wackiness of other Mario sports games like super strikers

Players would have the option to play in traditional mode similar to Madden where they would play as Mario characters or me characters any more serious realistic American football game void of all the wackiness of a Mario game for those that want to more traditional gameplay style or in a wacky Mario mode where they would play with the typical over the top whimsical elements that are found in Mario sports games.

And wacky mode players would have access to power ups and abilities that are not typically seen in football games. Traditionally like Madden such as the ability to grow in size or throw a bunch of fireballs at the opposing team via power-ups as well as having special abilities for things such as kicking end zones or tackling opponents like in Mario strikers games

I don't really have to say too much for the traditional mode for you of those that know football and how the game works. It'd be the traditional basic game. Nothing fancy

Teams:

The teams would consist of characters from a variety of different Mario games that have been in various different Mario sports games with the ability to play as mii characters and everything.

It'd be the typical thing where each character has their own advantages disadvantages all that stuff. Yada yada.

The characters would also have upgradable outfits in the game similar to super strikers battle league in terms of having different uniforms

One cool feature that could be brought back for the teams is the ability to create your own team logo similar to how you could create a design for your go-kart in Mario kart DS or you could stick with the ones given to you in the game

Stadiums: 

Another aspect of Mario game such as the strikers series is stadiums for the players. There could be stadiums with different things like pipes to go through throughout the field that allow you to dodge tackles and there could be ones with platforms that are higher to get a higher advantage in the air and there could be stadiums with obstacles such as piranha plants that come out of the ground at random times to obstruct players as they are running across the field

Having something with obstacles like I mentioned, such as piranha plants coming up out of the ground, would in turn keep players on their toes and make the gameplay vastly different from any other type of football game based on American football

Overall, I would love to see Nintendo do this. I highly doubt they ever will but for me and my family my dad doesn't really have the money to go out and purchase a PlayStation 4 or 5 or the newest Xbox and everything like that to be able to play Madden and it's not really cost effective to buy it if he's only going to play that one game. So it would be cool if Nintendo could do a partnership with the NFL and have NFL teams. But I highly doubt with EA sports having a monopoly on games because they make Madden that will never happen, but it would be cool. I'd like to hear your ideas and your thoughts based on the information I provided and any other ideas that you have",I think it's time for Nintendo to make a Mario American football game.,10rss3a

One interesting thing he said is that people often skip a major step in terms of portability, starting with the most powerful version and going straight to the least powerful version. But with Hogwarts Legacy they will do a gradual porting, little by little, starting with PS5, then PS4 and only then Nintendo Switch.

"With rumors of a [new Mario Baseball game](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/mario-sports-baseball-sluggers-nintendo-switch-game-leaked/) coming later this year, I’ve seen a lot of initial reactions that have been pretty lukewarm to the idea nowadays. And I can’t help but agree with them. Ever since 2011, we’ve gotten at least one new Mario sports game every single year, with the only completely vacant year being 2020. And the quality of each of these sports games have varied wildly. At their best, I feel they can rival some of the best Mario spinoff games ever made. And at their worst they are pure filler, meant to eat up a calendar slot until the next big release rolls around. So let’s take a quick look back at every Mario sports game to have come out in the past 10 years or so and see what we think of them in retrospect:

**[Mario Sports Mix](https://youtu.be/XEla32-TCA4):** Made by Square Enix and brings together 4 different sports in one. A fun distraction and got some cool minigames, but I’m not revisiting this anytime soon. At least it gave me the opportunity to dunk on a Behemoth from Final Fantasy using the power of volleyball.

**[Mario Tennis Open](https://youtu.be/LEs1wZohOpo):** Clearly a byproduct of Nintendo needing to push out more games for the 3DS following its first major price cut. The new chance shots completely dominate the gameplay and it feels more like you’re a cat chasing a laser toy. Not one I’m keen on checking out.

**[Mario & Sonic Sochi 2014](https://youtu.be/F0GROJ1F41E):** It’s the first Mario & Sonic game in HD yet somehow looks worse than the London game before it. I’ve never played this series and I don’t have any intentions on starting anytime soon. Surprisingly though, a 3DS companion version does not exist.

**[Mario Golf World Tour](https://youtu.be/5LfPg9lpx2k):** Actually amazing and super underrated. If your biggest complaints about recent Mario sports games are the lack of content on day 1 and the lack of any real “Mario” elements, I cannot recommend this game enough. It’s got so much worthwhile stuff to do for the single player, and the online is shockingly good! It even got a season pass that’s absolutely worth the price! Best Mario Golf game since Toadstool Tour (might even supplant it) and may actually be a strong contender for best Mario sports game ever made if I’m being real.

**[Mario Tennis Ultra Smash](https://youtu.be/PXBWAjxioSU):** Well… it seemed like the developers used up all their creativity points on World Tour, so there’s not much to say about this one. You can’t play with your friends online, you need an Amiibo if you want to play doubles by yourself, and this game was originally full priced. Yep. At least you can grow big here?

**[Mario & Sonic Rio 2016](https://youtu.be/z8l4UR_tGeU):** See my thoughts on Sochi 2014. Also one more thing of note is that there are no Dream Events in this game. Y’know, the thing most people actually care about?

**[Mario Sports Superstars](https://youtu.be/qQZCq9hHt5Y):** Game released on 3DS only a few weeks after the Switch and Breath of the Wild launched. Who here honestly cared?

**[Mario Tennis Aces](https://youtu.be/mMHT2vdWvpg):** Actually digged this one for a good while, and the story mode was a neat distraction with plenty of cool challenges. The core tennis gameplay was exciting and deeply strategic, the online worked pretty well, and there was a good variety of courts to play on from day 1. However I largely stopped playing right after Smash came out, but at least I can say I didn’t feel my time was wasted with this one. This was the first big attempt at the “free updates” model for the Mario sports games, wherein where Nintendo would dripfeed the rest of the game’s content over the course of the year. Apparently a lot of cool stuff was added post launch, but I only really came back to it every month to get those new characters right away.

**[Mario & Sonic Tokyo 2020](https://youtu.be/TsiuwvMdXdY):** See my thoughts on Rio 2016. But at least I can see that the developers clearly had fun with this one, with the Newgrounds-esque story mode and plenty of fun references. So that’s commendable.

**[Mario Golf Super Rush](https://youtu.be/aucAzFWpvMc):** One of the biggest disappointments I’ve had with a Switch game, probably *the* biggest if I’m being frank. The golfing itself wasn’t nearly as fun as the last game, the new story mode was painful to go through, there were barely any courses at launch let alone Mario themed ones, the online was terrible, and I really was just biding my time until the next big calendar release. This one was easily the biggest offender of the “free updates” model for me, and I dropped the game long before I could take advantage of that new content. I just… I hate this game so much… I’ll go back to World Tour now.

**[Mario Strikers Battle League](https://youtu.be/cLAzzYz92r4):** I’m pretty sure most of us forgot this game existed once Xenoblade 3 and Live A Live came out nearly a month after. After 15 years of nothing we finally get a new Mario Strikers… and it’s somehow got less to offer than the two previous games combined. I will give it credit tho, it looks freaking *gorgeous* and the core soccer/football mechanics can be fun to master, but I find it’s a real clusterfuffle to keep up with what’s going on in the field. But that didn’t change the fact that there wasn’t much we could do out of the box. You can play offline and online… and that’s it. This game was also arguably worse when it came to “free updates” than Super Rush, as it only added more of the same content. Heck, Daisy wasn’t even in the game at launch! At least I can say I played this one longer than Super Rush, but I’m not returning to it anytime soon. Next Level please just bring back Punch Out, that’s all I could ask for.",Hot take: I’m not really excited for any more upcoming Mario sports games.,10q16e8
"Alright, I may be going overboard with ""conspiracy"" but at the very least, there seems to be an issue out there of contradictory information to the first ever appearance of Popo and Nana. You may think this is an easy answer, but if you look online, things are a little messy. The NES version of Ice Climber was indeed released in **1985**. However, there was also an Arcade version of the game called ""Vs. Ice Climber"" supposedly first released at some point in **1984**. Let's look a bit deeper.

If you do a quick Google search of when Ice Climber was first released, it will tell you that it was first released in 1984, not 1985. This is ripped from Wikipedia, which has Ice Climber noted down as having first ever released as ""Vs. Ice Climber"" in **October 1984**. Looking around on multiple sites, you will find this same information, or in some cases, this information just completely omitted. 

That means to say that the North American Arcade version of Ice Climber was released before both the Japanese Arcade version (1985), and the Japanese NES version of Ice Climber (also 1985). Well now, that doesn't make much sense, given that Nintendo is a Japanese company and all. Is it possible they decided to release it in Arcades in North America before everywhere else? Well, looking at the release dates of every other game Nintendo released in Arcades would show that there's only one other time this ever happened: VS. Balloon Fight.

Now supposedly, VS. Balloon Fight released in North America on September 1984, and *then* released in Japan in October 1984. So, given they have done this before, it's not unlikely they did the same with Ice Climber right? Well, maybe... but where's the source of this information?

After looking for the source of this information for both VS. Ice Climber and VS. Balloon Fight, they both seem to point directly at the same Japanese book which details Arcade Game release dates. You can see them listed in this book [here](https://archive.org/details/ArcadeGameList1971-2005/page/n129/mode/2up). 

It turns out that this book has been noted for having several errors that have been verified separately in the past. Thus, it's not exactly the most trusted source on determining if both VS. Ice Climber and VS. Balloon Fight released in North America before they did in Japan.

With VS. Balloon Fight, at the very least, we know that it did indeed first release, at least in Japan, in 1984. There are Japanese ads for VS. Balloon Fight that Nintendo ran which show a Copyright Date for ""1984"", however, I cannot find a single ad for VS. Ice Climber that doesn't say ""1985"" instead, further indicating that VS. Ice Climber was not released in 1984.

And that's about where I am with looking into this topic. I tried looking on Nintendo's website, but I could only find word on the NES version, which definitely first came out in 1985 (today, January 30th, in fact). I also tried to take a look at Super Smash Bros, as I recall the All-Star mode in one of the games had you fight enemies in order of their first ever appearance. However, this turned out to be Smash for Wii U and 3DS, which unfortunately, do not feature Ice Climbers as playable characters. 

As I said, there's a lot of places online that say the arcade version was first released in 1984, so it would be great if anyone could find any further information so we can put this to rest.

(*Edit: [Someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/10p5sqo/the_ice_climber_conspiracy_what_year_did_the_ice/j6ihq4h/) pointed out that Smash Ultimate's All-Star mode also has the enemies fight in order of their first appearance, however it doesn't show exact dates, and since the two characters that Ice Climbers are inbetween are from mid 1984 to mid 1985, it doesn't help. Also of note is that the Ice Climbers trophy in SSB Melee states the Ice Climbers were first introduced in October 1985, but this is purely the NES release in North America. The PAL version of the game does not show dates whatsoever.*)",The Ice Climber Conspiracy: What year did the Ice Climbers first ever appear?,10p5sqo

"Welp, it's been a year since my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/sgqp71/i_was_tired_of_waiting_for_a_wireless_n64/) and I haven't caught the wireless N64 controller in-stock on Nintendo's website yet. A ton of new N64 games have come out over the last year and I can only imagine the nostalgic N64 player base has grown substantially too. My drive to help these players play these games the way they were meant to be played along with wanting to explore new microcontrollers led me to develop a new adapter that's much cheaper and easier to make than my last!

Similar to my last adapter, once everything is programmed (much more easily this time) and the adapter is hooked up to the N64 controller. All you have to do is plug a micro USB cable into the adapter and the other end into the dock (or into a USB C adapter plugged into the Switch if you're undocked) and you're ready to go! This adapter also added mapping L + R + Start to the Home button to stop you needing to reach for a second controller.

A piece of feedback I received on my original project that stuck with me was that the setup looked too complicated. I was excited when I found a way to address this when I recently discovered the Raspberry Pi Pico - a small, $4 microcontroller that's still readily available everywhere. You can program a Raspberry Pi Pico by simply dragging and dropping a single file! The last/Arduino project required downloading and setting up several tools in order to program a couple of different chips.

What's more is that there are several features with the Pico that I haven't even worked with yet that will allow me and others to develop new features in the future (e.g. spending 2 more dollars on a Pico W would allow you to communicate with the Pico over the internet)

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback!

"This might seem stupid but hear me out.

Over the past 10 years or so we've seen a lot of emulators for their old games, mostly in the form of software emulation. But I recently learned about something called the Analogue Pocket that is essentially a spruced up Game Boy Advanced built with an FPGA (as I understand it) so you can actually use your own old dusty GB games and plug them in to play. This is a really cool project (and I don't understand really how it's legal) but it's amazed me it's taken this long for something like this to come along. Anecdotally, I don't really want to pay $300+ on eBay for a third party product like one of these, but if Nintendo had built it I'd consider it for sure. 

So it makes me wonder: why Nintendo hasn't done something like this themselves? I recall back like 7-8 years ago they remade the NES when they released the NES Classic Edition, but to my knowledge they've done nothing since. The old hardware for a lot of their handhelds and consoles has appreciated quite a bit and it makes me wonder why they haven't tried to tap into this market. 

I suspect maybe they have market research that suggests the market for ""vintage gaming"" isn't big enough to make a project like this profitable for themselves, but if it's working for Analogue why wouldn't it work for Nintendo?",Why doesn't Nintendo remake some of their old hardware?,10qedjc

 * ***Ice Climber*** was released in 1985 for the Family Computer in Japan. In this platform game, developed by *Nintendo*, it's only you and an ice hammer as you make your way to the top of the mountain! As Popo, players use a trusty mallet to work their way up a mountain. They chip away at the blocks overhead, then jump up through the resulting hole to the mountain's next level. Once Popo reaches the top level, he enters a fast-moving bonus stage in which he can pick up veggies and, hopefully, reach the summit for a big point payoff.

"So I heard a rumour on the internet (Shocking I know), about Nintendo starting to produce more switches in their factories. So there will be more switches coming to the stores this year. And since there is more switches being made, it probably means we won't get a new console in the next few years.

 * ***Sujin Taisen: Number Battle*** (known as ***Number Battle*** in North America) was released in 2009 for DSiWare in Japan. In this puzzle/strategy game, developed by *Mitchell Corporation*, a new kind of board game combines puzzle and strategy in a battle of wits. Take turns against human or computer opponents to reach a target score, by placing numbered tiles on the board. Score points by linking the arms of each tile in various ways: tiles with the same number or sequence of numbers, and tiles in a loop. Also look out for special squares that affect play in new ways.

   
   
 * ***Photo Clock*** was released in 2009 for DSiWare in Japan. In this utility, developed by *Nintendo*, a clock displays photos taken with the Nintendo DSi Camera in the background.

"Like any long-standing game company, Nintendo is no stranger to celebrating their franchises with compilations. They’ve been compiling games ever since the PlayChoice-10 arcade cabinets (which were way before my time) to as recently as Nintendo Switch Online. But while other Japanese publishers like Capcom and Konami have had a more consistent track record with their game compilations, Nintendo has a noticeably spottier reputation when you consider their output. They vary wildly in quality, but I’m gonna talk about a few compilations out there that I own (along with one that I don’t), one per game franchise:

**[Super Mario All Stars](https://youtu.be/OGW4wrVTdow):** This was released for the Super Nintendo in 1993 and brought us 16-bit remasters of Super Mario Bros 1, 2, 3, and Lost Levels AKA the original Super Mario Bros 2. Along with the new visuals came remastered music and new jumping physics, some of which caught me off guard when I first played it. I was used to the more generous physics of newer 2D Mario games, so seeing Mario lose momentum when hitting blocks definitely raised an eyebrow and led to me getting hit every once in a while. I own the Wii version with none of the physical extras, which is apparently just the old SNES ROM burned onto a Wii disc with no new changes or additions. Very underwhelming, especially compared to what’s coming up.

**[The Legend of Zelda Collector’s Edition](https://youtu.be/q0nkWYcJF30):** This was a special set available in the early 2000s as a preorder bonus for the then-upcoming Wind Waker, as well as to subscribers of Nintendo Power magazine some time later. This bundle includes Zelda 1, Zelda 2, Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask, along with a demo disc for Wind Waker and a retrospective video on the series up to that point. As someone who did not grow up with a GameCube, I had to rely on secondhand accounts on the collection’s quality. And based on what I’ve seen across the interwebs, the emulation of Majora’s Mask in particular was quite problematic. But the collection did include the first ever official release of Master Quest for Ocarina, so that’s something.

**[Metroid Prime Trilogy](https://youtu.be/u8klx34R8m8):** It’s hard to believe that there was a time where we doubted an unknown American studio would be able to recapture what made the 2D Metroid games so special. Yet here we are with one of the strongest video game trilogies of the 21st century and fans begging for more. This immaculate 2009 collection brings together enhanced Wii ports of Metroid Prime 1 and 2 along with the third game and a multiplayer mode into one dual-layered disc. The first two games were re-outfitted with Prime 3’s Wii controls, and they play beautifully with the remote in my opinion. It’s so seamless to just point at whatever problems needed shooting, and you don’t even have to think about it. However these new controls are mandatory, as you can’t revert to a more traditional controller if you want to play that way. The credits system (basically an achievement system you can redeem for extra goodies) was also applied to the first two games, but some credits are unusable nowadays given that they previously relied on the Wii’s online services to operate. This collection is available digitally on the Wii U eShop if you don’t wanna pay a premium, but that’s going away in less than 2 months so act fast.

**[Kirby’s Dream Collection](https://youtu.be/nA6cqE5gDIs):** This might just be Nintendo’s magnum opus when it comes to game compilations. Released for the Wii in 2012 as the final first party Nintendo game for the system, HAL Labs pulled out all the stops to celebrate the pink puffball’s 20th anniversary. Right from the outset, you can jump into six Kirby games ranging from the original Dream Land to Kirby 64, which play about exactly as you remember them. But the best thing about this package in my opinion are the extras. There’s an entire set of new exclusive challenge stages based on Kirby’s Return to Dream Land, one of which allows you to play with the Smash copy ability! In addition the museum mode features an interactive timeline with cute bits of real world trivia, scans of box sets to mess around with, gameplay videos of games not featured in the collection and, most shocking of all, three full length episodes of the Kirby Right Back At Ya anime series. It’s a wonderful tribute to the franchise, and I suppose my only real gripe is that it never released in Europe or Australia for some reason.

"I think most people who have owned a Wii U would agree that most games didn't do a lot with the Gamepad. Some Wii U games didn't require the Gamepad at all and could be played entirely with a Pro Controller (although that may be a good thing if you love the Pro Controller).

But, I do think there were some games that used the dual-screen functionality well:

Nintendo Land - this launch title definitely has my favourite uses of the Gamepad. Minigames like Mario Chase, Luigi's Ghost Mansion, Pikmin Adventure, Yoshi's Fruit Cart and Takamaru's Ninja Castle would be difficult or even impossible to port to the Switch. Luigi's Ghost Mansion had the most creative use of it, with one player being a ghost and invisible to the other players on the TV. It makes for a very fun minigame where the ghost can surprise the other players due to the lack of screen cheating.

Pikmin 3 - I haven't played the Switch port of this game, but I think this game made good use of the Gamepad. You could use a Wii Remote to aim and throw Pikmin, while using the Gamepad to get an overhead view of the map and direct captains with the touchscreen. I think the Gamepad was implemented smoothly without being too gimmicky.

Xenoblade Chronicles X - This is one of many games that uses the Gamepad for a map, but there is a bit more to it. You can use the Gamepad to place mining probes which earn you money and resources as you play the game, and you can use the probes as fast travel points.

Super Mario Maker - Definitely the best use of the Gamepad for a single player game. It still works fine on the Switch, but I definitely prefer the Gamepad for making levels.

Hyrule Warriors - the singleplayer barely uses the Gamepad, but it is pretty useful for multiplayer. One player uses the TV while the other uses the Gamepad, so there's need to split the screen in half.

DS Virtual Console - the Wii U is the only official way to play DS games on a TV, and it accurately replicates the two screens of the DS. Games like Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, and the Pokemon Ranger games feel very suited for the Wii U. It would be very hard to make these games work on Switch. Once the eShop shuts down in March, these games may be sadly lost forever.","Are there any Wii U games which used the dual-screen functionality well, in your opinion?",10lqkaj

"with the exception of the 1989 Mario Ice Capades and Pokemon Live (although both are made in America), no Nintendo game ever had any sort of stage play/musical show or adaptation produced in Japan.

despite that, there were many stage plays and musicals of video games from other companies like: Persona 3, Devil May Cry, Resident Evil (as Biohazard Musical), Danganronpa, Ace Attorney, Touken Ranbu, Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, Fate/Grand Order, Nier Automata's YoRHa, etc.

"Because I’m absolutely loving it now! When compared alongside the other consoles in Nintendo’s lineup, I’ve noticed a lot of fans tend to gravitate towards the GameCube. And I can understand why; its library is filled with so many one-of-a-kind experiences, many of which haven’t really been replicated in subsequent console efforts. But there was a reason why it came in dead last during that console generation, right? Despite its strong library in retrospect, the PS2 and Xbox crushed it and that’s just a plain fact. If you’re gonna treat the GameCube’s lineup with this much relish and nostalgia, why aren’t people doing the same for the Wii? I mean isn’t that the true mark of a good console’s worth?

The narrative around the Wii these days is that it was a gimmicky casualtastic shovelware sonata. And after watching something like Nintendo’s infamous E3 2008 press conference, I can definitely see why many would think that. But obviously, I wholeheartedly disagree. The Wii gave us so many quality first party games that people tend to dismiss when generalizing the console’s legacy like this. We got the Mario Galaxy games, two new Zeldas, a bunch of Kirby games, awesome Mario Kart and Smash entries, the Virtual Console, the New Play Control line which gave us excellent ports of Pikmin 1 and 2, revivals of dormant franchises like Wario Land and DKC, and Nintendo actually gave a shit about Metroid that generation! Heck the Wii was the console that gave us Xenoblade Chronicles, for crying out loud. Oh and about the whole “shovelware” thing? News flash: every successful console had shovelware. The PS2 had it, the PS4 had it, and even the Switch has it; just take one cursory glance at the “coming soon” section on the Nintendo Switch eShop.

And yes third parties didn’t sleep on the Wii either; the quality stuff was always there, you just had to search for them. We got excellent ports of Resident Evil 4 and Okami, a hidden gem of a fighting game in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, an actually great Sonic game in Sonic Colors, an exhilarating sword combat game in Red Steel 2, revivals of Klonoa, Samba De Amigo, A Boy and His Blob, NiGHTS and more! Over the past several months give or take, I’ve been digging deeper and deeper into the treasure trove of quality exclusives that the Wii had in store. At this point in time I’ve acquired over a dozen Wii titles physically from both first and third party publishers, plus a few others through the Wii U eShop. [Here’s my current stack of physical games so far for those curious](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/799008375131340860/1066155879877066793/IMG_5655.jpg). And now I’m just gonna go through a couple of the ones I own and have put a decent amount of time into:

**Punch Out Wii:** A phenomenal reboot that beautifully translates what made the NES game so special into the modern age. The arcade-style gameplay and gorgeous cartoony animations are amazing to behold. It’s a tough game to master, but boy is it ever addictive to watch my opponent finally go down every single time. This might just be my favorite game on the entire console, and I’m itching to go back and clear more of the extra challenges the game has to offer.

**Zack & Wiki:** A delightful point and click puzzle adventure game and a brand new IP from Capcom of all things. The Wii controls are used to great effect here and it even went on to win several awards when it first came out. It’s a damn shame we never got more out of this IP; I would’ve loved to see where Capcom would’ve went with it given the advancements in motion control since 2007. At least it got acknowledged in that one Wii golf game Capcom also published, which I also own.

**MadWorld:** You may have heard of a little company called PlatinumGames. Y’know, the folks who made Bayonetta, Astral Chain, and Metal Gear Rising? Well this was where they made their debut and what a way to make a name for oneself. This was a gory, over-the-top beatemup depicted in a striking black and white artstyle, akin to the graphic novel Sin City. The ways you can impale a dude to a wall or saw their arms off are ridiculous, and the boss fights ramp things up in typical Platinum fashion. If nothing else the soundtrack is an absolute bop if you’ve got an ear for hip hop, so give it a listen when you’ve got the free time!

**The Last Story:** If you know about Xenoblade, chances are you’ve least heard about The Last Story to some degree. This was one of three big JRPGs that avid fans famously campaigned for a North American localization, alongside Xenoblade and Pandora’s Tower (which I also own in the latter’s case), but this one shouldn’t be slept on if you consider yourself a fan of the genre. It’s an action RPG produced by Mistwalker, the studio created by Final Fantasy’s original creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, and with music done by legendary Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu. They previously worked together on the Xbox 360 exclusives Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey, and this stands right alongside them as some of their finest work. Characters are grounded and endearing with wonderful British voice acting, the real time combat system is tactical and never gets boring, and the soundtrack is sublime as expected of Uematsu. And it all wraps up in about 20-25 hours or so, making it a fantastic fit for more time-conscious RPG players who just can’t get down with playtimes the length of Xenoblade or Persona these days.","Looking back, why did so many Nintendo fans hate the Wii so much?",10lsg54

"Hey everyone, just a huge Luigi's Mansion nerd here.

I remember back in the day after Luigi's Mansion 2, there was all this buzz on this sub about what the setting could be for a, at the time, hypothetical Luigi's Mansion 3.

Shockingly enough, I remember a lot of people being exactly right with the idea of a haunted hotel!  I had never even thought of that concept but when they said it, it was so perfect and I couldn't see it going ANY other way.  Of course, Luigi's Mansion 3 has been out now for a few years and some youtubers (Arlo) are musing on the idea of a Luigi's Mansion 4.  Does anyone else have any ideas on what the new haunted location could be?

[I saw one idea for a haunted cruise ship in a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJTPbZeEgbk) by Nin10doland, which would be amazing.  Maybe going back to the roots to an even bigger mega grande mansion like the first? Haunted Peach's Castle? Maybe a haunted resort on Isle Delfino?!

And where could they go with plot?  Is it getting stale to have characters stuck in portraits?  We know Mario has to be unavailable for SOME reason because otherwise Luigi wouldn't be forced to be the hero again.  Im completely drawing a blank on that though...

 * ***Picross DS*** was released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS in Japan. In this puzzle game, developed by *Jupiter*, the word Picross is a combination of ""picture"" and ""crossword puzzle"". Each Picross puzzle consists of a grid whose cells need to be filled with squares and crosses. By doing this correctly, you essentially 'paint' a picture. There are numbers at the head of the grid's columns and rows which signify how the grid needs to be filled out, but it will take a sharp mind to figure out the solution.

"
Waluigi's (derived from the Japanese word 'warui' meaning evil, compounded with 'Luigi'; thus Waluigi means something like ""evil Luigi"") first appearance was in 'Mario Tennis' for Nintendo 64 which was designed by a company called ""Camelot"". So Nintendo did not work at all at this game. The only reason Camelot created Waluigi for this game was, that they needed a second character who can play together with Wario in a team. So this means that Waluigi is the first and only Super Mario ""main-character"" who was neither invented nor designed by Nintendo themselves which could be the reason why he so often does not appear in the ""main-line"" Mario games and it seems that Nintendo has no love at all for this poor guy.

Since 'Mario Tennis' Waluigi is just existing for the reason he was originally  intvented: for being a stopgap in various spin-off-mario games. For example his first appearance in a Mario Kart game was in 'Mario Kart Double Dash' (they once more just needed a character who plays together with Wario). Since then, he's been part of the character roster of neatly every Mario Kart, except for 'Mario Kart 7'. Which is funny because they even added a playable ""Waluigi's Pinball"" remake to the game but not Waluigi himself. They kicked him out to make space for Wiggler and Honey Queen, which is kind of bizarre in my opinion.

but it feels like this is just the top of the iceberg:

Even if it seems like Waluigi is an important character in the Mario-World-lore at a first glance, this is just be true for the spin-off games but not for the ""main-line-games"" since hes not even allowed to be anywhere near to such a game. The reason behind this, in my opinion, cant only be fact that he was invented as a stopgap. Toadette for example in the first way was created as a stopgap too. The only reason to add her was that Toad needed a driving partner in 'Mario Kart Double Dash'. But she still made it into the ""main-line"" game 'New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe' as a playable character. In 'Mario 64 DS' there are also different playable characters avaible. Such as Mario, Luigi, Wario and ..
Yoshi (?). Even if that would have been the perfect steep template for introducing Waluigi into the ""main-line-games"" they decided to not implement him. In the Mario Version of Monopoly the ""Waluigi-field"" is the most cheap one. In 'Fortune Street' Bowser even says something like ""nobody likes you"" to Waluigi, which makes me kind of sad for him.

fun fact: not even Luigi (the character who is known for being always scared by everything) does not take Waluigi for full bc he says ""Luigi not afraid"" when at their first encounter back then.",the unloved character (Waluigi),10jcalk

 * ***Eigo de Tabisuru: Little Charo*** was released in 2011 for the Nintendo DS in Japan. In this educational/puzzle game, developed by *Nintendo*, based on the 2008 educational anime about a Japanese puppy named Charo who is mistakenly left in the JFK. airport in the U.S., Charo must learn to speak English if he is to befriend the local dogs and return to his owner, Shota, in Japan. The game features animations in spoken English with Japanese subtitles, interspersed with minigames, puzzles and quiz questions to help the player understand key English phrases.

"So this is the thing: according to Bloomberg's reports, Nintendo is increasing the production of Switches, implying that they're still going to sell it for a really long time, so Switch's successor is NOT coming next year like we thought. 

At this point, I think we can even expect the next 3d Mario game and Metroid Prime 4 coming to Switch itself. Admittedly thought, this really confuses me: I was really convinced that Nintendo was going to release the next console next year, using the two games I mentioned as launch year titles. Plus, Switch already sold 120 millions of units, making it the third best selling console ever (after PS2 and DS, althought I don't think it will manage to reach them, they sold 155 millions at their time) I don't know how many console they really expect to still sell at this point. Plus from the last months of 2021 to the end of 2023, Nintendo will have released one mainline game for most or its major IPs, and 2023 itself seems that is gonna be poor with just three major titles (Fire Emblem Engage, Zelda Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4), four it we consider the remake of Kirby's Return to Dreamland. Exvluding Pokemon, it takes 3 or 4 years for a new entry of their IPs to release after the previous one, and unless they plan to revive dormant IPs like F-Zero or Punch Out, I don't see any imminent announcement for the next future aside Mario and Metroid Prime.

So this is what I wonder: is Nintendo still going to rely on Switch that much in 2024, relying on just the next Mario game and Metroid Prime 4? And if its successor will release in 2025 instead, on which games will it supposed to rely on in its launch year?",Switch's successor might not coming soon.,10hp9zm

"People seem to think that if there was a newer, more powerful Switch console then games from third party developers would run better, but that's actually not the case at all.

Third party developers always target the absolute limit of any console. So new games on a potential ""Switch Pro"" or ""Switch 2"" will actually run equally as well as games run on the current Switch, because developers will just target the absolute peak of what that system can put out the same way they do on the current systems.

Sure, they may be shinier with higher resolutions and features like raytracing, but they won't actually run better, especially since most developers prefer to target resolution over targeting framerate.","New Nintendo hardware will likely not actually make games run better, because third party developers will just target the absolute limit of that new hardware like they do now with the Switch",10grw0e

"Pretty much a standing statement. Mario Kart Wii is, IMO, the GOAT of Mario Kart games. The Wiimote Wheel was perfect. They tried to do it with the tiny wheels for the switch, and it just didn’t feel the same. 

Mario Kart Wii was unforgiving. You lost your weapons if you crashed. Unlocking characters was a chore. The online play was brutally competitive. 

Given how long Nintendo has invested in Mario Kart 8, I feel like Mario Kart Wii is a distant memory for most, and a completely foreign game to many who never had a Wii. 

Can Nintendo ever move on from Mario Kart 8? Thoughts?",Mario Kart Wii - the GOAT,10g26t9
"So I'm going to start off with describing the smartphone. This device would be designed to stand out from other smartphones on the market. It would do this by offering features and functionality to take advantage of the Nintendo brand. It would run on Android with a custom skin that gives it a distinct walk and feel along with pre-installed Nintendo apps such as a fitness app with me, characters and the ability to connect with friends and family for fitness challenges and maybe some mobile games.

The phone would have the typical smartphone specs that are typical like a good camera processor screen resolution and stuff like that. The phone would also have the ability to use amiibo figures in some of their mobile games and everything

Now for some of the apps like the clock app, it would have a unique design with the clear and easy to read in her face that displays the current time and date in it. The app would also have a variety of different clock faces Jews from including some that are themed around popular Nintendo characters and franchises. The alarms would also be integrated with the fitness app and your watch. You can also get those clock faces for the app onto your watch as well, but it would allow you to set alarms that are tied to their fitness goals such as waking up early to go for a morning run or to do some stretching before they go to bed.

The same thing goes for the calendar and weather app etc. It could have some design that uses some Nintendo characters in it's  design.

Now one of the cool features of this phone is the ability to set me characters using the camera or creating them yourself with the messaging app which could just be Google's messaging app or creating their own custom but messaging app on the phone. But you want to be able to set your contacts with me characters or a variety of custom profile pictures similar to the Nintendo switch.

Now on to the smartwatch it would be a device that is specifically designed to work with the phone though They can have it work with any phone. They probably would go with the route of having it be exclusive to their phone It would obviously can modern design that feels like Nintendo. It would have the common things like a color touch display that would show the time and could also show other functionality on the watch faces such as fitness and health metrics such as steps taken, calories burned and distance traveled. The watch would also have a built-in heart rate monitor like other smart watches which would allow for more accurate tracking of physical activity It would also have other built-in features like the ability to pay for goods and services with the watch. Like most other watches, it would have the essential features that both smart watches have

Now some key features of the smartwatch would be the ability to connect with the built-in fitness app on the phone. Users will be able to set fitness goals, tractor progress and compare their results with friends and family who have the watch watch, but also have the ability to connect to the Nintendo switch or future consoles with games like Nintendo switch sports or ring fit adventure, allowing users to track their progress in those games and having those specific games show up in their fitness tracking app and how many calories they burned while playing those games, as well as allowing you to earn rewards for reaching certain goals in those games

Nintendo could also have a variety of custom watch faces using certain Nintendo characters and everything that would be available for the watch, one of which would have your me character on the screen that you can tap on and get in more in-depth look at your health and everything. They can also include a variety of different watch bands have a Nintendo feel such as a watch band that has a Pikachu pattern, a Kirby pattern, or a Mario pattern

I think the concept of having a Nintendo phone and a smartwatch would be really cool and could be beneficial to Nintendo because they could incorporate some features that would be unique between their phones and their consoles together. Like I mentioned for the smartwatch, having the ability to connect with fitness games would be pretty cool and everything. I also think Nintendo getting into these markets. Yes, there's a lot of different companies already in this market, but I think Nintendo could make it difference by incorporating elements of their consoles UI design and Android 13 to come up with the coolest type of phone. I like to see what your guys's thoughts are and what other ideas that you guys have for this idea and if you like this idea",My idea for an Nintendo smartphone and smartwatch that would be pretty darn cool,10g7fso

" now, a few weeks ago, I was kinna bored so I decided to go on amazon and buy one of those crappy 500-in-one combo carriages. You know, for the heck of it. So it comes, and I don't play it for a while. (my 2ds charger broke) So I pick it up a few weeks later, and it was basically your average combo-cart deal. A few great, but glitchy games, shovelware, shovelware, shovelware, lots of shovelware. So I decided to pick a random game and hope for the best. (the combo cart was buggy as hell so the text for the games wasn't showing) so I click on some random game to which some strange logo appears in the background and text starts scrolling. The first time I saw it, I wasn't actually sure what is said but as I read it a few more times I realised what this was. A dev message, and a good one at that. In the text, the dev downright insults the game calling it ""a bucket of shovelware"" and starts to talk about a bunch of random stuff like other devs, personal messages and a bunch of over stuff. The text then ends with ""see you in the next release"" and the game starts up. And guess what this particular game is called? some kid's game Paws and claws: regal resort. Wow. So either they had no game testers and the management didn't bother to check the game, or being put on a combo cart messed up the game a lot. I looked around on the internet a bit and couldn't find find any documentation on this, so I thought I'd post my findings to the subreddit. If you stumble upon a legitimate copy of this game and had a similar/different experience please let me know. Once again, the game's called paws and claws regal resort if you wanna try it out. I'm also curious on weather this happened on the sequels to this titles, as there are many. Thanks for reading this, by the way.

"So for context, I had a Link Between Worlds 3DS, purchased around 2014, but it was stolen by the end of 2015.

So now that the eshop is closing, I wanted to get a new one, maybe recoup my old account and get everything I wanted, mainly Pokémon and Zelda games for the 3DS.

So I looked for a month, to find a locked 3DS in good condition, but was unable to, in my area. I ended up buying a brand new one. I tried linking my old account, but wasn't able to, it was already linked to another 3DS, so I ended up creating a new one, and because I needed to test the 3DS and because I'm super impatient, I bought X, UM and Crystal on it.

Meanwhile, I sent an e-mail to customer support trying to get the old account back. It was a back and forth of about 4 e-mails, they asked a bunch of information about my old NNID, my old 3DS and my new one. Also means of contact, and preferred times to receive a call.

After that it went silent for a while, I was expecting the call, but the week went by, and nothing. Come friday 13th, I receive a call, the agent said that the request was sitting there because there was another account linked to the 3DS system I informed them about, and they wanted to check if it was mine. I told them it was, explained the situation, and then they told me they were proceeding with the request, the system transfer for my old account, and they asked if I wished to merge the two accounts together.

I didn't even know that was a possibility, I said yes, and they told me I would get an e-mail with further instructions.

That was the end of it, by friday's night I was logged into my old NNID, and downloading a bunch of games I didn't even know I had. Though I couldn't find the 3 purchased on my new NNID though, so I e-mailed them back, because I had not gotten any news from them. Turns out they were on another tab on the redownload page. Sadly, I was missing UM. I think they added the update, instead of the game, I don't know if it was a glitch in the system or a misclick by the operator.

So I e-mailed them again, and just now, they added UM to my account.

So, TL;DR, I got my old account back which I assumed was lost, and even the games I spent on a second account I got to add to the original, so I wouldn't lose any money spent. And this was done over two weekends, with quick replies even during sundays.

"Crossovers can be a beautiful thing. They can also feel like the drunken ramblings of a madman come to life by some stroke of fate. And I don’t just mean things like Smash Bros, Mario & Sonic, or Mario + Rabbids; everyone knows about those by now. There are some crossovers out there, some quite recent, that you wouldn’t imagine in your wildest dreams. I’m gonna talk about four of them here, and these are not just simple guest appearances in games that can otherwise do without them:

**[Mario X Puzzles & Dragons](https://youtu.be/OkDxCwg0U4Q):** P&D is an incredibly popular mobile puzzle game in Japan, and it got a crossover with Mario in 2015 for the 3DS. It’s a mix of a three-match puzzle game and a monster collecting RPG, and in the Mario version the monsters you collect are Mario baddies, like a Koopa riding a Cheep Cheep. I’m not a big puzzle guy myself, but I do enjoy Dr. Mario from time to time. This series is still going on the Switch today, but they haven’t taken a stab at another Mario collaboration since. It’s pretty cheap on the eShop!

**[Zelda X Crypt of the NecroDancer](https://youtu.be/oYd_pph6RnI):** Crypt was a rhythm-based roguelike that originally came out in the mid-2010s, with music done by the composer for Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac. One morning in 2019 during the Nindies Direct that also announced Cuphead for Switch, Nintendo and developer Brace Yourself Games drunkenly stumbled in and announced their lovechild, Cadence of Hyrule, a sequel to Crypt that would be a collaboration with Zelda. It was released in June with a DLC season pass coming the following year.

**[Pokemon X Nobunaga’s Ambition](https://youtu.be/SaG5c-hZNBU):** Let’s take one of the most accessible RPG series around and combine it with one of the most complicated genres in gaming. Pokemon Conquest was announced and quietly released in 2012 for the DS, a whole year after the 3DS was out. This combined the vast roster, type matching, and evolutions of the core Pokemon games with the grid based map of a tactical RPG and set it in a region inspired by feudal Japan. And the story actually treats Arceus with more gravitas and respect than anything else up to that point! This was a key player in Nintendo and Koei Tecmo’s relationship, as it would eventually lead to the Nintendo Warriors games and KT’s involvement for Fire Emblem Three Houses.

**[Fire Emblem X Shin Megami Tensei](https://youtu.be/L_gYQCOlW9E):** So uh funny story. Atlus originally pitched this idea as a crossover between Fire Emblem and Pokemon, but the aforementioned Pokemon Conquest was already in production at that time. So a crossover with SMT it was then. Atlus was given free reign to create an RPG they never had before, so wave goodbye to the demons and phallic monsters of the SMT series and say hello to the bubbly pop idols and bright colors of contemporary Tokyo! This would give the game its namesake: Tokyo Mirage Sessions. Gameplay relies on the traditional “press turn” system of previous MegaTen titles, only now with combo extenders called Session attacks and Fire Emblem’s weapon triangle. Also your party members wield FE characters as JoJo stands, and Marth goes Super Saiyan and sings in Japanese at one point.",The Wide World of Batshit Crazy Nintendo Crossover Games,10boh6v

"My never grew up with Nintendo games, however I did play 2 of them with a friend who did have one. Smash bros. Ultimate and Mario kart Wii. With this new super Mario movie im ecstatic to see. And I really hope it does very well. 

I may be the only one probably and I might be crazy for thinking this, but with this movie coming out this year I wonder if we will get more Nintendo license franchise movies in the future. 

Possible future Nintendo movies:

Metroid

Star Fox

The Legend of Zelda

Super Smash Bros.

Animal crossing

I can see a possibility of Zelda being most likely to a future fantasy action/adventure style movie. There is a chance with not only movies but a full on Nintendo IP series on TV or Streaming services. 

I would say Animal crossing would be a perfect And great choice to be a comedy series similar to the office but focused on the town a people more oriented to kids and families

It would moat likely be an CG animated Pixar style-ish(most likely Illumination) Series and I Think the voice actors for the characters

I could be wrong and we might have another one like as it could be considered by some people another movie adaptation of a video game I.e. Uncharted, last of us series on HBO max, tomb raider movies Angelina Jolie played Laura in. This Mario movie i know for a fact will and has great potential. Im not a big fan of Illumination cause the ""minions"" are overrated in a way but they are still the best talented animation studio for a mario movie. I just Hope with this we will get to see more Nintendo movies; not just Zelda, star fox, and metroid, but also fire emblem smash bros, and Kirby. 

Once the Mario movie makes record box office sales i bet we'll see this as a push for others companies to do the same

Disney can easily EASILY make a Kingdom hearts movie or series on Disney+. And maybe just maybe... A series adaptation of GTA San Andreas?

"Some quick background as to where I stand on Pokemon spinoffs. I’ve never been one to dive into the mainline games, and frankly I believe I’m better off for that given TPC’s recent business practices. So it was to the spinoffs where I would seek my Pokemon fix and I think I’ve gotten a few bangers under my belt.

My first real foray into the world of Pokemon spinoffs was the Pokemon TCG game for Game Boy Color. It’s basically like the core games, but with deckbuilding and a crapton more RNG to contend with. Thankfully since I was playing this via the 3DS Virtual Console, I could save scum until I got the results I wanted. And while I have yall here, you got less than 3 months to buy this game before the 3DS eShop shuts down, so if you’re interested at all then go add some funds and get on that.

My second (and only other) spinoff experience was New Pokemon Snap for the Switch. This was apparently something that fans have been wanting now for over 20 years, and based on the reception it appears to have delivered on that front. More Pokemon, more replayability, more online features, and even more content via a random post-launch update a few months later. Not much else to say other than it’s more Pokemon Snap. I played using gyro controls because gyro aiming is pretty much essential for me on controllers and I had a fun cozy time.

My next (and probably last, at least for a while) spinoff venture will be [Pokemon Conquest](https://youtu.be/SaG5c-hZNBU), a tactical RPG for the DS that also serves as a crossover with Koei Tecmo’s longrunning TRPG series Nobunaga’s Ambition. I mainly bought it because I enjoy turn based strategy games, but I also looked at some top 10 lists and most if not all of them called Conquest the best Pokemon spinoff ever made. That’s pretty damn impressive given it didn’t sell all that well due to poor timing, launching in 2012 right in the middle of the Black and White 2 prelaunch hype cycle.

" I don't mean to be an insider, but hear me out

Nintendo just added this thing to the Switch Eshop called ""Old School Classics"", which is just the NSO subscription services  
There is NO point for Nintendo making that, since they already have a dedicated section on the Eshop (and the Switch)  
So here is what I am thinking, this either means  
A: They are organizing stuff like Doom and Mario Bros and collections on the Switch to put onto there, so it is easier to get  
**OR**  
B: Nintendo is planning on bringing back Virtual Console in some form (and maybe they just wanted to dump on everything at the same time)

"Since the new Mario movie will release early this year, I think it would be a great opportunity to have a decently bigger year for Mario, at least compared to 2022. Here's what I expected for 2023:

A new 3D Mainline Mario game - I think it's the right time for a new mainline entry. Not only it's been 5 years (almost 6) since Odyssey, but it would also be perfect as a Holiday release alongside Zelda ToTK in the same year, similar to what happened in 2017. It could be Odyssey 2 or something completely different. I know that Bowser's Fury was released in 2021, but I feel like that was a more of side mode for the 3D World port than anything else. Also, I don't expect to be a mainline 2D game, because we already have NSMBUDX and SMM2, which it would have their respective sales be interfered by that game. Maybe on the next console as a reboot, or maybe not, who knows.

A new Donkey Kong game - It's been rumored from time to time and I think this would be a good year to release it. If it's going to be 2D, 2.5D, or 3D, that's a whole other story.

A third Mario Baseball game - That one is pretty straight forward. We got Mario Strikers: Battle League last year, so why not a baseball game? It's the only major Mario Sport series that the Switch still doesn't have. Although, it could also be released in 2024 instead.

Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 - And finally, the only game that I'm 100% sure that will be released this year. It's already been a tradition for a Mario & Sonic games to be released a few months before the year the Olympics is predicted to take place. The only exception being Rio 2016, that was released on the same year.

Miscellaneous (games that could be releasing this year but it wouldn't have much of an impact):

- Mario vs. Donkey Kong

- Dr. Mario



Games that I don't think we are going to see released this year:

Mario Kart 9 - We are already getting new Booster Courses in MK8DX, so a new Mario Kart game will only happen on the next console.

Another Mario Party game - We only get a new mainline Mario Party game for every 3 years since NDCube (9 in 2012, 10 in 2015, Super in 2018, and Superstars in 2021), so a 2024 release instead.

Another Paper Mario game - We only get a new Paper Mario game for every 4 years since Sticker Star (SS in 2012, CS in 2016, and TOK in 2020), so also a 2024 release.

Mario & Luigi - Despite being the 20th Aniversary of this series, the future of this series has been a mystery ever since AlphaDream got bankrupt, so it's safe to not expect anything from it (at least for now).

Wario Land - It's be 15 years since the last game of the series was released (2008), so I have no idea if it's going to come back or not.

Captain Toad sequel - Idk

There are other game sequels I didn't mention, but I would be repeated myself a lot, and most of them would be unlikely for simply already having games on the Nintendo Switch.

"My favorite Nintendo games, Smash Bros. and the Fire Emblem series (spoilers included) have been stressing me out for a long time (I have autism) because some of these games hint themselves in being pro-dystheist (the belief that a deity responsible for the world’s creation is malevolent). This is a common thing with main antagonists in Square Enix and Atlus games, which I don’t like anyways, but it has plagued games I actually enjoy. As a disclaimer, I am not highly religious, in fact I am less religious than the average person, but anything regarding a “creator of the world” who wants to do bad things massively upsets me, both because I think this type of story writing and the whole belief of dystheism is really controversial, incredibly depressing, and that I struggle every day with a disability and depression (I don’t want to believe I was created for malevolent reasons!!!).

In the Smash Bros series, the evil Master Hand is the source of creation of the Smash world and Crazy Hand is the source of destruction. Similar with their masters, Galeem and Darkhon, but nothing about them is truly made clear. Master Hand has also been manipulated by Tabuu in Subspace Emissary and one of them, when freed from Galeem in World of Light, fought player-controlled against their minions in the near-end of the story mode. Overall there’s a lot of pseudo-dystheism (two evil hands representing creation and destruction of the world) and confusion the Smash lore that really stresses me out.

Not all Fire Emblem games stress me out, but certain ones that have a creator god/goddess do: Radiant Dawn’s Ashera and the Heroes’ app Alfador (who hasn’t even been made into a character yet). But also Three Houses’ Rhea/Seiros as an antagonistic Jesus figure. Ashunera is a goddess who creates the world of Tellius as well as the races of humans and human shape-shifters. When the clashing of her people and the racism between the humans and shape-shifters becomes a disastrous issue that challenges her emotionally, she splits herself into Ashera (order and reason) and Yune (emotion and chaos). Yune ends up destroying most of the world in a Genesis-esque flood and is sealed away in a cursed medallion, and Ashera becomes the alpha goddess. In the events of Radiant Dawn, Ashera is woken up from a sleep where she finds out the beings she created just won’t stop killing each other, and turns a lot of people into stone. Yune is freed from her medallion and is enlisted in Ike and Micaiah’s crew to stop Ashera from resetting the world, as well as the corrupt Begnion church. The good news is after defeating Ashera, Yune gets her to chill and they reform back into Ashunera. What affected me though in Radiant Dawn was the sense of “this seems dystheistic” when we find out Ashera, the goddess everyone prays to thanks to the corrupted church, plans to end the world, and quotes like “blind faith” or similar are used in the game.

In the Fire Emblem Heroes app, Alfador, creator god of Zenith, is a parody of Odin from Norse mythology and has two daughters named after Thor and Loki. Unlike mythology, both Thorr (as she’s called) and Loki are evil and carry out the malevolent orders of Alfador, quoted “he who created all” and similarly. Even though Alfador has not appeared in Heroes yet, his mentioning and the writing’s lean to pro-dystheism totally ruined the app for me.

In Fire Emblem Three Houses, Seiros is the daughter of the creator goddess Sothis (who thank goodness isn’t evil), identical to how Jesus in the Bible is the son of God. Seiros creates the Church of Seiros and is even celebrated in a holiday in late December like Jesus. That’s pretty much where the similarities end. Seiros/Rhea isn’t evil but not a great person (she’s the final boss “immaculate one” in Edelgard’s path) and that’s how the Jesus connection stressed me out.

Being a high fantasy game fan, I would like to play the two Xenoblade Chronicles games, but I also heard controversy on those games regarding religion.

Are these games’ obviously dystheistic moments included on purpose like someone wanting to spread a message to Western audiences? I would also like to know how to get over my stress and anxiety over this so I could enjoy gaming and continue to enjoy my favorite games.",“Evil creator gods” in my favorite Nintendo games ruin them for me.,107mzik

"I found out that Nintendo and Sony Electronics had a deal in the works to make the CD-ROM addon for the SNES, but also Sony was working on their own Nintendo Console, the ""Nintendo PlayStation"", but got canceled, after the partnership fell through cause of Nintendo Backstabbing. With the knowledge Sony gained through the initial partnership, they made the PlayStation One. This console crushed the Nintendo 64 in sales. Thought this was really interesting and I didn't know Nintendo made their biggest rival in a way.

"So this is the thing: regardless the outstanding sales of Switch, Nintendo... is not in a good position lately. They keep getting a lot of crap, in the last year there have been multiple ""Nintendo sucks"" videos on YT, and the general userbase of Nintendolife has become vile and nasty torward it, and the worst thing is... all this hate is having repercussions on the general appreciation of the games.

It's true that Nintendo has made quite a few... debatable decisions with Switch, between the Joycon Drift and Switch Online not being quite good, but for how I see it, regardless these problems, Switch has one of the best lineups of any Nintendo console ever, and the fact that doesn't get much appreciation because of the way people see Nintendo... makes me really sad.

Also, this whole mess, has quite some hypocrisy in it: On the opposite, Sony lately has done plenty of crappy things, even worse than Nintendo's ones in the last year (like expensive services that are not that worthy, and a raise in the price of PS5 outside the US), but people easely forgiven them only because... God of War Ragnarok. Yeah, with a single game Sony managed to be forgiven for the crap they did lately. So why are not people as forgiving with Nintendo as they are with Sony since, you know, they released way more quality games than them in the last year? 

In any case, for how I see it, making quality games is not enough anymore for Nintendo, if they rewant the general appreciation from the fans, they need to do something else. The question is... what? What does Nintendo need to do to get appreciation again (and most importantly, that their games don't get unfairly hated because of this mess)? To you the word.",What Nintendo must start doing in order for their games to regain appreciation again?,106rp9t

"It both does and doesn't.

I see this repeated a bit often by folks and I don't think they've ever tried it - granted, getting 16 players requires a lot of stuff.  Anywhoo, here's the deal.

Double Dash on the GameCube made use of Nintendo's Broadband Network Adapter to allow you to connect multiple GameCubes together and play (local) multi-player Mario Kart.  Double Dash also featured a unique ""love it or hate it"" mechanic where each Kart had two characters on it - a driver and a rider.  The effected gameplay in several different ways, but what is relevant to the discussion here is thatr, when playing, you could either have one player control one Kart (and two characters) or one player control one character (or half a kart).  What you can not do, in any multiplayer mode, is have one player control one kart while two players control a second kart.  Unless you make the one player use two controllers... which is really hard to do in Double Dash.

So, the breakdown:

1 TV, 1 GCN, 1 MK:DD and up to four controllers allows up to four players.  One player, one kart/two characters, 2 players, two karts/four characters, 2 players, one kart/one character each, 3 players, three karts/two characters each, 4 players, four karts/two characters each, our 4 players, two karts/one character each.

You can keep this up to 8 consoles linked together, but after 8 players (either eight karts/two characters each or four karts/one character each), you'll only be able to play with an even number of players - since you can't have more than eight karts, more than eight players requires each player to team up with another and play in pairs.  If you have 9, 11, 13, or 15 players, one person is SOL.  So, the game actually supports up to 8 players, or 10, 12, 14, or 16 players.

Fun fact of the day for you.",Mario Kart: Double Dash doesn't truly support up to 16 players.,106tbp8
"I used to own a GameBoy back in the day but never played any Zelda game. Now that I was feeling a bit nostalgic I decided to give Link's Awakening a chance on the Switch. As I understand it, the game's basically the same as in the 90s, save for the new cute graphics. And it really shows! For example, there's a room with three enemies. No hints whatsover. You kill them, nothing. You look around, nothing. You walk around the whole island thinking you missed something else, nothing. Finally, you go to YouTube and guess what? You have to kill them in specific order for treasure to show up. However was I supposed to know this??

"It has now been over a decade since the original [Bravely Default](https://youtu.be/voh6NEpwEVY) was released back in 2012. That game was kind of a big deal for Square, as their attempts at moving forward with their flagship Final Fantasy franchise weren’t necessarily home runs. By the time the original Bravely came out in the West, the last two big Final Fantasy games we got were Lightning Returns and FF14 version 1.0, and that’s all I’m gonna say about those two. Still even though Square is looking big towards the future with games like Final Fantasy 16, FF7 Rebirth, and Kingdom Hearts 4, they didn’t forget their roots.

But that’s enough prologue, let’s talk about Team Asano. This group at Square Enix was indirectly formed by veteran producer Tomoya Asano, who made a name for himself with the 2009 DS title Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light. This game was a throwback to a simpler time for JRPGs, with classic tropes brought to life with new hardware and a job class system reminiscent of Final Fantasy 5. It got a decent amount of acclaim and a sequel would swiftly be planned out. Long story short, they wanted to make it a new IP for the upcoming 3DS instead and that’s how Bravely Default came to be.

As implied earlier Bravely’s success made waves for Square, and it helped them realize that there was still very much a market for more traditional RPGs in the modern age. We got a direct sequel a few years later with [Bravely Second](https://youtu.be/pGYP73s9rcM), another [standalone entry](https://youtu.be/Hv2Zvj49Y2g) for the Nintendo Switch in early 2021, and several other games that Asano also produced, all of which employ a striking new visual style dubbed “HD 2D”. Even if you never owned a 3DS, chances are that you’ve encountered at least one of these Switch games at some point or another, including:

**[Octopath Traveler](https://youtu.be/Fmi8KrntszI):** This was the debut title for Team Asano and Square Enix’s HD 2D line of games, crafting diorama-like depictions of 2D pixel sprites on 3D backgrounds. These looks are complimented with an engaging turn based battle system, an addicting job system, and eight individual character stories to sink your teeth into. It went on to sell over 2.5 million copies and spawn two sequels: a mobile prequel game with in app purchases, and a [standalone sequel](https://youtu.be/-jXBsqSXD0U) coming next month. Good times.

**[Triangle Strategy](https://youtu.be/7nhTJ-Evv_U):** Someone at Team Asano must’ve been like, “Hey let’s take that awesome visual style we made with Octopath and put it into a tactics game!” This reinvigorated the strategy RPG genre with a story of deep political intrigue and a moral choice system which can take you down one of several endings. The game was also a commercial success, selling nearly a million copies in its first month as a pure Switch exclusive. Looking forward to the eventual sequel, especially with how much Square loves strategy RPGs nowadays.

**[Live A Live](https://youtu.be/G0oOta9Lfts):** This was what many have been asking Square Enix to do with this graphics style: remake their older sprite based RPGs with it! And their first go at remaking a classic RPG was with a one-of-a-kind game that never originally released outside of Japan, one that Westerners mainly know about because Undertale took some inspiration from it. When this came out back in July 2022 exclusively for the Switch, it became many people’s RPG of the year, even beating out Xenoblade 3 in their eyes.

**[Dragon Quest 3](https://youtu.be/FmfiqydPjVk):** While people were begging Square to remake Final Fantasy 6 or Chrono Trigger in this style, Square Enix showed up at a Dragon Quest anniversary livestream and showed off this glorious HD 2D revival, stunning the eyes of many. As of this writing there is no concrete release window for this remake, but I’ll be sure to pick it up on day 1. I just personally hope it’s not right next to Tears of the Kingdom. That would really suck.","What do you think of Square Enix’s decision to keep making throwback RPGs on Nintendo consoles (Bravely, Octopath, etc)?",104lai5

"Have you ever wondered how Nintendo was able to get so many developers to create games for their motion tracking controllers, like the Wii Remote and the Joy-Con? While other companies, like Microsoft with their Kinect, struggled to attract developers to their own motion tracking technology.

Well, there are a few key reasons why Nintendo was able to succeed where others failed.

First and foremost, Nintendo's motion tracking controllers were simple and intuitive to use. The Wii Remote, for example, had just a few buttons and a built-in accelerometer, which made it easy for developers to create games that were accessible to a wide audience. In contrast, the Kinect required users to stand in front of their TV and make specific body movements, which was not as user-friendly.

Another reason for Nintendo's success was the fact that their motion tracking controllers were integrated into the hardware of their consoles. This meant that developers didn't have to worry about compatibility issues, as every Wii or Switch console came with the necessary controllers. On the other hand, the Kinect was an optional accessory for the Xbox, which made it harder for developers to justify the additional effort of creating games for it.

Finally, Nintendo's motion tracking technology was able to capture a wide range of movements, from simple gestures to more complex actions. This gave developers a lot of creative freedom when it came to designing games, as they could come up with all sorts of interesting and unique gameplay ideas.

So, there you have it – a few reasons why Nintendo was able to get developers to program for their motion tracking technology, while others like the Kinect struggled. Do you have any other thoughts or questions on this topic?",Why Nintendo's Motion Tracking Technology Succeeded Where Others Failed,1069hot
"I don't have any sources to back this up, but from what I've seen on the internet, people generally seem to prefer Luigi's Mansion 1 to Dark Moon. I was wondering why, for the sake of discussion.

One of the main talking points I see is that Dark Moon is mission based and linear, while the first game isn't, and that because the first game is more freeform, it's the better game. 
But that isn't true, right? There's a set path in Luigi's Mansion 1, railroaded to you through specific keys you have to obtain to unlock specific doors. There's no way to break from this path or forge your own way through the mansion. It's as linear as Dark Moon, maybe more linear since the mission structure in Dark Moon allows the previously visited environments to change between missions, always keeping backtracking interesting.

Sure, you can go back and explore previously unlocked rooms in 1, but why would you? You already explored them, and unless there's a boo that has fled in them or you're trying your luck for RNG treasure, you're done, and theres nothing new to look forward to. There's no compelling reason to backtrack...

...Except for the blackout, which does change things up in the first game by flooding you with ghosts. It also allows you another chance to collect ghosts/treasures and the only way to catch Uncle Grimmly. The blackout is the only time where backtracking is interesting in the game, and it's a shame it's the only standout in that department.

The other main point is ambiance and sound design, and that 1 had a much more spooky feel to it than Dark Moon. I fully agree, Dark Moon is definitely more silly and lighthearted compared to 1, and I feel more 'immersed' in the 1st game than I do in Dark Moon, which quite consistently undercuts the tension with jokes.

"There are persistent rumors about Switch's successor coming next year. While per se I think it's almost granted that Switch's successor will come out next year, I don't think it will be revealed during this year, if not during December. For a simple reason: announcing it in the middle of the year would mine the sales of Switch for the rest of the year. Sure a reveal during the E3 would give it a lot of visibility, but that would ruin the sales of the current console for Christmas. 

So in the end, I feel Nintendo will play it strategically, and wait for the right time to properly announce it, and personally, I don't think it will be before December, or January 2024.

"Hi r/nintendo. Greetings from Venezuela. Casually I've seen this sub and wanted to make a post about those mario characters that appeared only one time in a game and after that never showed again. Falling almost in the void of the forgotten ones.

I want to talk from two characters that appeared in Mario RPG games. These characters are Booster and Jojora. (I wanted to include Geno but because he is property of Square Enix and The license with Nintendo expired i Will not include him)


Let's begin with Booster. The totem like man that first appeared in Super Mario RPG legend of seven stars. This character celebrated a wedding without knowing exactly how. Also how to forget his ""Loco Express attack"" or the Uphill chase to Marrymore. A very funny character that i want to see again in a cameo or a easter egg reference.

And now Let's go with Jojora. The ice Fairy girl that debuted in Mario & Luigi Super Star Saga. This character deserves special mention. Not only for having a cute design, but also for being one of the strongest bosses in the game, at the point that looked a semifinal boss. When you defeat her, simply desappears and you don't find her anymore. That makes her a memorable character. And for that i hope Nintendo puts her in a future Mario game, at least in a minor appearence or a short major one.

Tell. You think Nintendo should include one of these characters in a future game?

"I mean a direct port of the PC version of the classic Ragnarok Online game. Not a reinvent like they've done with a lot of Ragnarok mobile games.

Make it work with the switch controls and the touch screen exactly as the game is. Clean it up a bit, sure, but don't change anything drastically.

Keep the music, the sprites, the animation and combat styles - all of it.

I'd say the only way RO could, or even should functionally be improved to be more accessible, would be to have it fully voice acted. At that point, it'd just be an unbeatable game IMO.

If Nintendo and Gravity actually sat down and spoke, they could make this work. And it would be absolutely massive for both of them in terms of sales.

I'm sure I'm not alone in being willing to shell out a pretty penny for a custom release Switch dedicated to Ragnarok Online if they do this.

RO is a very old game now, too. I was basically a kid when it came out and now I have a kid of my own who also loves to play RO but doesn't grasp PC gaming yet. I think this aspect of family bonding is also very in line with both Nintendo and Gravity and could be promoted as good way for parents and kids to bond and game together with a game that is really unlike anything else.",Port Ragnarok Online to Nintendo Switch,104l2wi

"I am currently replaying *Kirby's Return to Dreamland* in anticipation for the remake. As a *Kirby* fan, I'm pretty excited! This is the first mainline remake since *Kirby Super Star Ultra,* the first *Kirby* game I ever played as a child. I think that this game with some tweaks can be as good, if not better, than the likes of *Triple Deluxe* or *Planet Robobot.* I'm not saying the game is bad; this entry is fantastic. I have a few ideas for how the game can improve, though they may be a little more technical:

\- More ability challenge rooms, please! Considering they added Mecha Kirby, it seems appropriate.

\- I hope that >!Extra Mode allows you to play as other characters than Kirby. I understand this might make the energy spheres harder to find, but the Arenas allow you to play as other characters after you clear them. Why not make Extra Mode the same? !<

\- I'm sure that the moveset tweaks from future games (minus *Forgotten Land*) will be incorporated (i.e. King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Bandana Dee's new moves from *Star Allies* coming back). I also hope attacks like Spinning Fire Breath for Fire and Revolution Beam from Beam return. Those attacks gave their abilities more midair options.

\- I hope the game adds some extra stages and >!new bosses. I'm 90% sure Morpho Knight will be in the game.!<

\- Finally, this last one may not be realistic, but I hope Super Abilities are modified in some way. In the Super ability sections, you kinda just do the same thing over and over again. The only Super Ability with any real puzzle solving is Flare Beam. In other games, the Robobot Armor and Mouthful Mode had more moves, puzzles, and options, so they felt more fun to use. In other words, I kinda want the Super Abilities to be more engaging. Right know, mechanically, they just feel like being able to use Crash Kirby over and over again with less frames...

So those are my two cents. What do you think?",My Wishes for Kirby's Return to Dreamland Deluxe,101g3bw
"I played through this game this year. The gameplay is drawing circles around Pokémon to gain their friendship. As you level up ranger rank you can have more Pokémon at once (up to 8 late game) and they all follow you around in the overworld. They all have one time use overworld abilities to eliminate obstacles. The gameplays pretty simplistic (hey, so are the mainline games), but the gameplay LOOP (haha) is really fun and actually gets pretty damn complicated in the late game. Just drawing loops around Pokémon is suprisingly satisfying, and also pretty difficult. The gameplays great, but that’s not where the game shines. The pixel art sprites of the game look really good, and I think are my favorite out of any older Pokémon game. The game has a lot of charm with the graphics, following Pokémon, and especially the dialogue. The dialogue and characters are without a doubt the best part of this game, when they’re usually insignificant in most mainline games. The humor is actually funny, even to me as a 15 yr old, unlike the “humor” in most Nintendo games. The characters are all pretty memorable and all contribute to the plot well. Speaking of which, while I won’t give any spoilers the plot is pretty damn good with your slow rise up the ranks starting as a student learning the basics of being a ranger. I would highly reccomend this game to any Pokémon fan, even if your just a fan of the concept and not the mainline games. I will say though DONT PLAY THIS GAME ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN DS/3DS HARDWARE! I played in on a N3DSXL with no issues, but playing on something without a touch screen + stylus would be absolutely miserable. Also if you’re on an XL model, you should hold start when launching the  game to play at original resolution. It’s not a huge deal or anything, but the pixel art looks a lot better, and imo it was better to play with the smaller chunk of the screen.",Pokémon Ranger 2: Shadows of Almia is an s tier Pokémon game,100sive
"All I can say is: just glad I finished the damn thing! Yes, it was enjoyable at times, but it was most painful...for reasons I will get into...

First some background. I'm a lifelong Nintendo fan, owned every Nintendo home console from the SNES as a 9yo in 1995 to the Switch, Gamboy and DS. I played a bit of A Link to the Past but never finished it. Got BOTW when I got my Switch and loved it. Poured many hours into it, some of the fondest in my 30 years of console and PC gaming. One of the greatest games ever. Then I got Skyward Sword and thoroughly enjoyed it too...but as I implied, Ocarina of Time was mostly a chore to play through. For some reason, I never got it on my N64, and since then I'd heard many accolades, how it was such a classic etc, so was glad when I could play it on Switch ..unpopular opinion I know, but I'll say why. First the good:


First off, I'll say it isn't a bad game, and I can easily see why it's a classic. It established the template for future 3D Zelda games the way Super Mario 64 did Mario games. The music is so moving and memorable, the world vivid and story engaging. I genuinely had a lot of fun, but and it's a big but...

The first is probably a me thing..never been the best at puzzles, and I struggled a lot. Maybe I am dumb in this department lol. Never have I had to consult walkthroughs both video and text as much as this game. Not with Skyward Sword or BOTW. How the f**k would 12 yo me have coped in 1998? Would've definitely needed a guide. Some of the levels etc are just so cryptic...

Which leads me to Navi. What is the point of her if she barely actually gives you helpful hints? Like Fi in SS. Just says the same old things for the most part and sounds annoying lol.

The controls: maybe this is a Switch thing, but substituting the C buttons for an analog stick meant frequently selecting the wrong thing. Like say navi when you want to shoot an arrow or bomb when you want to hookshot or something. Needless to say this was so frustrating. 

Which brings me to Z targeting. Combat and boss fights were in a pain in the ass. When locked on your target often went off target and camera. I get it was 1998 but still, I felt most of the difficulty was dealing with that, otherwise they were fairly easy.

So yeah, while I did have some fun I just found Ocarina so frustrating to play...but at least it was on Switch where I could 'cheat"" with suspend points. No way would I have thr patience without it on N64. And I got all 120 stars in SMB World. I much preferred BOTW and Skyward Sword. Just my subjective opinion.",Just finished Ocarina of Time for the first time on Switch...glad I never played it on N64.,102bumy
"Hi everyone,

So, I'm a LOOONG time lurker, and I do occasionally put up posts into this subreddit. I'm a huge Nintendo fan and have been my whole life! I was a Day 1 Switch owner, and I've loved my Switch since the day I bought it.

Now, this Christmas, I decided to purchase a Steam Deck due to the incredible emulation that I found out about... now, before I go any further, I'm not looking for this thread to be a discussion about how the Switch + Steam deck are similar/different.

One thing that really surprised me was quite how powerful the Steam Deck is - games like God of War and Horizon are able to run, and they don't look half bad. So, I'm genuinely curious, do we NEED a new piece of hardware soon? Or, is Nintendo going to continue on the trajectory its on, and keep allowing shovelware/bad versions of games to be released on their platform? I would love to hear peoples thoughts and opinions on this!",Do we need new hardware?,101qehh

 * ***Wrecking Crew '98*** was released in 1998 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this action puzzle game, developed by *Nintendo EAD* with *Pax Softnica*, Bowser has built skyscrapers all over the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario sets out to take them down. Challenge each of the enemy characters in the story mode. Portions of wall drop from above and you have to break them or move them along conveyor belts. If the blocks reach the top of the screen then you lose. Destroy matching walls to drop unbreakable iron walls on your opponent.

   
   
 * ***Power Lode Runner*** was released in 1999 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this platform/puzzle game, developed by *T&E Soft*, you play as Mugurukun, as he collects the building materials found on each stage. Enemies wander about the stages, Muguruken's only defence is to blast holes in the ground. If enemies become trapped in the holes, they can be passed over safely. Be careful not to trap Muguruken in a hole, however, or the stage will have to be restarted.

   
   
 * ***Power Sōkoban*** was released in 1999 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this action/puzzle game, developed by *Atelier Double*, Medusa has trapped characters from Japanese folklore in her castle. You play as a demon as he escapes from the castle and works his way to Medusa, freeing all of his friends. Each screen of the castle contains a block puzzle. Push the rocks and drop them all into the holes to clear each stage. As you solve puzzles you will free your friends, and they will power you up to face the boss battles.

"Last year I made a post talking about how Nintendo could royally screw up 2022. However that year has past and we are officially in 2023 so I am going to do it again. As before, this is only a parody and these predictions are not meant to be taken seriously.

January: Instead of announcing dlc for Scarlet and Violet, Gamefreak announces two new versions, Pokémon Hyper Scarlet and Hyper Violet for November of this year. The game features new areas based off Morocco and southern France (Kalos) however it fixes none of the performance or graphical issues from the original games.

February: A new Nintendo direct is posted, it is mainly focused on Tears of the Kingdom with a small update on Pikmin 4. However ToTK is criticized for the lack of new content compared to BoTW. Along with the direct Nintendo also announces a price increase to $70 for all of their first party games, including Pokémon. And their YouTube partner’s program is reinstated. A new mature 3D Mario game is announced produced by Miyamoto. Said to be a new reimagining that will redefine gaming and will be the next major step in not just the franchise but gaming as a whole.

March: Advance Wars 1 + 2 are canceled due to the war in Ukraine

April: The Super Mario Bros movie is released to nearly universal backlash. It gets a 20% on Rotten Tomatoes and is a box office flop, prompting Nintendo to cease their partnership with illumination

May: Tears of the Kingdom gets a last minute delay to July to “Deliver the ultimate Zelda Experience”

June: Pikmin 4 is randomly shadow dropped. While the game is okay, it suffered horribly from poor sales due to the game’s poor marketing, destroying all hopes that we would get a Pikmin 5. Nintendo announces a new 4K switch pro model to coincide with the new Mario game. It also supports 60fps, however it is over $500

July: Tears of the Kingdom Finally releases and and met with fairly positive reception (even in the worst case scenario, it’s still Zelda!) however it was criticized for being too similar to BoTW given the amount of time that has past. Since the last game.

August: Nintendo gets sued by a disgruntled employee for supposed racial discrimination. Despite these allegations being proven true, Nintendo wins the case due to the amount of money and their legal divisions. This leads to a mass exodus within the company.

September: A new direct is posted however it is considered by many to be the worst direct in ages, with the only first party announcement being a new Kid Icarus game,

October: The switch pro and the Mario game are released on the same day. However the new Mario is in a terrible state. With the game essentially being unfinished and broken. Devs come out about the game’s development, the game suffered horribly from development hell and some devs were literally worked to death just to get the game out. The game is so horrible it permanently ruined the reputation of the Mario franchise. On top of that, 50% of Switch Pros that were sold suffered from serious hardware defects. There are even some reports of people’s consoles exploding. 

November: Pokémon Hyper Scarlet and Hyper Violet are released. The games somehow are even more broken than the original. Along with the 70$ price tag, they became the worst selling Pokémon games in history.

December: The same disgruntled employee from earlier hires a hacker. Nintendo suffers a massive data breach, over 5 TB of data is leaked onto the internet. Everything from full early prototypes of all of Nintendo’s first party games from the 80s to today. Even all of their games that have yet to be announced, along with the source code was leaked.

"While Nintendo has a reputation for taking down fan projects, in reality they haven't actually taken down very many unless the games try to serve as a replacement or recreation of an official Nintendo product. For example, there are hundreds of Mario and Zelda fan games that Nintendo has never touched. 

All one has to do is search a site like itch.io for ""Mario"" or ""Zelda"" to see several free fan games that have had no claims or removals and have been available for years, many of them very high quality.

What Nintendo does shut down though are fan remakes of games, especially when they're planning on selling their own version soon. Also you often see takedowns for anyone who hosts ads, has monetization in their fan games or asks for donations.

It's actually really safe to make a fan game so long as you don't directly infringe upon an existing game.

Note that Pokémon seems to be an exception to this but this isn't Nintendo per se, but the Pokémon Company, which is severely protective.","YSK - While Nintendo is well-known for sending DMCAs to fan games, in reality they haven't actually issued very many takedowns except in cases where people were trying to make a replacement or a recreation of an official game, or monetizing their fan games in some way",100f9a2

"The music of the Zelda series is some of the most memorable and influential in video games. And in some of the games it even has a prominent role, being incorporated into the gameplay and as part of a cohesive narrative.

This is the reason why i wanted to see how it is made and the cultural and game design influences that go into it. This is why I was happy to learn that the actual music from the games made during the Nintendo 64 era (and even beyond!) lives inside the games' ROM files and code. After playing around a with some tools, I managed to get the original music files used. Everything is there, from the instruments used to the instructions on how they should be played, and the note sequences. Now we can get almost perfect reproductions of the music as standard music files. Thus, i decided to do a throughout analysis of the music and get as in-depth as possible into how it is made and what went into the compositions and sound design.

For the moment, i just finished the analysis of the two games of the Nintendo 64 era; with the resources, it was easy to make music visualization videos where you can see the exact notes played and all the instrument that go into each of the tracks. you can also check out additional media that helps to point out some aspects of the music. Here is a full playlist with each entry and the analysis; my wish is also to get more contributions and comments about each piece in order to get a complete understanding of the music, along with your thoughts on the tracks: [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVv3ELJlNuw&list=PLETz1iOEUzpfCNJZNECrGiCR-2HJKXy_p)

I hope this will be great to gain more appreciation for the music and a valuable resource for musicians and audio enthusiasts. An extensive investigation went into the music and I’m sure you will find lots of interesting info, specially of you are interested in media composition and how, with limited resources, the composers of the era managed to create the music in older system.

I also want to continue with the project and perhaps start incorporating different games and consoles in order to create video game music encyclopedia that can become a good reference for music enthusiasts. so if you have other soundtracks where you would like a similar treatment please let me know.

The original intention was to do the project in an even more interactive way, something where you can click on the particular set of instruments you want to hear at a time, but I have not found anything out there that can do that. If any of you know some way to do it I would be glad to know. Something like this: [https://streamable.com/x73wbt](https://streamable.com/x73wbt)

In any case, a lot of care was put into the making of these games and it shows in the music. so i hope you find it interesting. Please tell me what you think and you can ask me any questions about the soundtracks or how video game music was made, I am going to try to dig a little more info. There are interesting tidbits like some of the equipment the composers used and even where they specifically got some of the sounds and inspirations” For example, for Goron City: [https://youtu.be/9U2vpsgvdx0?t=103](https://youtu.be/9U2vpsgvdx0?t=103)",The Legend of Zelda Music Encyclopedia: an analysis of the theory and influences behind it (future games coming),zz4ar8

It's there any supplementary material for the Mario Kart or sports games that explains why these past versions of characters can access this time period?

Sidebar: it's really lame that the only main Mario characters explicitly allowed to have children are Bowser and the Kongs.

People always point to the shots of Peach looking serious and confident in the trailer, and always assume that she’ll now be just a one-note competent warrior that only cares about being strong.

But I feel this shot during the Mario Vs DK fight is one that is severely overlooked by most people. It shows a glimpse at another side of Peach.
She isn’t begrudgingly shaking her head at the sight of Mario failing. She has a look of genuine concern and care for Mario. Letting out a feminine, Peach-like yelp and putting her hands to her chest at the sight of him getting pummeled.

The producer even stated that they wanted Peach to express “a wide range of emotions.” Peach will have a confident, leader side to her. But that feminine Peach side is still there. There’s just a little more going on with her now.

"The Super Mario and Donkey Kong series have a long shared history, full of enmities, camaraderie, and goodhearted rivalry.

At the heart of it all, however, lies one large contradiction. Today, I’d like to address this issue, and introduce you to an important revelation.

Please join me in this journey of studies, revelation, and arbitrary conclusions, as I introduce you to undeniable proof that there are, in fact, two Marios in the Super Mario and Donkey Kong cannon.

## The Two Marios

First off, let’s establish some preliminary facts, by going back to where these characters began.

## Donkey Kong - 1981

## [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Donkey\_Kong\_flier.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Donkey_Kong_flier.jpg)

(Keep the cabinet art in mind, it’s going to be relevant later.)

This is the first appearance of both Donkey Kong and Mario. There are some important takeaways here:

**Fact 1: The original Donkey Kong, henceforth known as Donkey “Cranky” Kong Sr. is an adult ape in the early timeline.**

**Fact 2: At the time of Donkey Kong Arcade, Mario is an adult man.**

**Fact 3: Mario favors red overalls over a blue shirt.**

**Fact 4: Mario has a girlfriend named Pauline.**

**Fact 5: Mario works on a construction site.**

## Donkey Kong Jr. - 1981

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/Donkey\_Kong\_Jr.\_arcade\_promotional\_flier.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/Donkey_Kong_Jr._arcade_promotional_flier.jpg)

Moving right down release order, this game sees Donkey Kong Sr. captured by Mario and, if we are to follow lore materials, being treated rather poorly. In comes Donkey Kong Jr. to the rescue.

What can we glean here?

**Fact 6: Mario is capable of mistreating captive animals. (?)**

Considering the kind and heroic soul we know the modern Mario to be, this is a rather unusual revelation. Yes, I suppose he goes on to stomp and punch turtles all over, but those are acting agents under Bowser’s orders. This seems more like wanton cruelty than fighting back against an invading force. Let’s keep this in mind.

## Mario Bros - 1983

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/Mariobrothers.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/Mariobrothers.png)

Here, we meet Luigi, Mario’s brother. Before looking into him, however, let’s take some notes:

**Fact 3.2: Mario favors red overalls over a blue shirt in Donkey Kong, but blue overalls over a red shirt in Mario Bros.**

**Fact 5.2: Mario works on a construction site, then as a plumber.**

The change in clothes is easily explicable as simply varying his wardrobe, but what’s with the profession change?

Luigi’s presence also raises a question:

**Mystery A: Where was Luigi at the time of Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.?**

One would think that the heroic Luigi would join his brother in rescuing Pauline, and perhaps talk some sense into his animal-abusing brother?

Let’s keep that in mind as we move on.

## Wrecking Crew (1985)

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Wrecking\_Crew\_cover.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Wrecking_Crew_cover.jpg)

We see Mario as a solo act once more. What’s more, in the single player mode of Vs. Wrecking Crew, the arcade version, Luigi acts *against* him.

What more, Mario is back in the red overalls and blue shirt, and back at construction and demolition work.

This is getting very confusing, isn’t it? Let’s recap so far, adding our new knowledge.

**Fact 1: The original Donkey Kong, henceforth known as Donkey “Cranky” Kong Sr. is an adult ape in the early timeline.**

**Fact 2: At the time of Donkey Kong Arcade, Mario is an adult man.**

**Fact 3: Mario favors red overalls over a blue shirt when working on construction sites, but blue overalls over a red shirt when working as a plumber.**

**Fact 4: Mario has a girlfriend named Pauline.**

**Fact 5: Mario works on a construction site sometimes and as a plumber at other times.**

**Fact 6: Mario’s brother Luigi is a helpful ally while working as a plumber, but has an unexplained enmity when working as demolition workers.**

**Mystery A: Where was Luigi at the time of Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.?**

**Mystery B: Why is Luigi opposing Mario in Vs. Wrecking Crew, and absent in Wrecking crew?**

With that in mind, let’s move on.

## Super Mario Bros. series (Various)

[https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/10\_share\_images/portals\_3/2x1\_SuperMarioHub.jpg](https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/10_share_images/portals_3/2x1_SuperMarioHub.jpg)

In the interest of brevity, I’m rolling in together every ‘Mushroom Kingdom’ Mario game. If Donkey Kong isn’t involved at all and there’s no specific insights to be gleaned from other games, they’ll simply be counted here.

What do we learn?

Now that we’re getting a good look at Mario, he’s looking somewhat younger, isn’t he?

Look at that smiling mug above. Does this look like the same “Jumpman” who went up against Donkey Kong Sr.?

Must be an art shift, right?

Let’s table that for now.

**Mystery C: Why does Mario suddenly look much younger?**

Mario’s back in the blue overalls, and on excellent terms with his brother. Why, we’re just flipping back and forth, aren’t we?

## Super Mario Kart (1992)

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/38/Supermariokart\_box.JPG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/38/Supermariokart_box.JPG)

Looks like Mario and pals are getting along great, and it seems that Donkey Kong Jr. is along for the ride.

Hm.

I don’t know about you, but if a man held my father captive and mistreated him, then used all kinds of traps to stop me from rescuing said father, I wouldn’t exactly want to go karting with him.

Admittedly, Bowser is also here, but… You know Bowser, he’s a big doofus when he’s not actively being a villain.

**Mystery D: Why does Donkey Kong Jr. happily join the Kart racing with Mario and pals?**

Okay, it’s been a big journey to get here, but we’re getting to the heart of the mystery. This is the big one.

## Donkey Kong Country series (1994+)

Showing up alongside Donkey “Cranky” Kong Sr., it’s the son of Donkey Kong Junior, henceforth known as **Donkey Kong III**. This is the heroic ape we all know and love.

But… wait a minute.

Old Cranky’s looking like age has been taking a toll, hasn’t he?

Mario, though? Mario’s looking fresh as a daisy. If anything, he’s significantly younger than the old ape’s former nemesis.

What’s up with that?

This is where it all comes together.

The inexplicable return to youth. The flipflopping wardrobe and occupation. The convoluted brotherly relationship.

It all points to a simple conclusion:

This isn’t the same Mario. This Mario is Mario “Super” Mario Jr., son of Mario “Jumpman” Mario Sr., and brother of Luigi Mario.

Let’s go over the facts with that in mind:

**Fact 1: The original Donkey Kong, henceforth known as Donkey “Cranky” Kong Sr. is an adult ape in the early timeline.**

**Fact 2: At the time of Donkey Kong Arcade, Mario “Jumpman” Mario Sr. is an adult man.**

**Fact 3: Mario Sr. favors red overalls over a blue shirt. Mario Jr. favors blue overalls over a red shirt.**

**Fact 4: Mario Sr. has a girlfriend named Pauline, who may or may not be Mario Jr. and Luigi’s mother.**

**Fact 5: Mario Sr. works on construction sites. Mario Jr. works as a plumber and adventurer.**

**Fact 6: Mario’s brother Luigi is an ally to his brother but has opposed his father in the past.**

**Mystery A: Where was Luigi at the time of Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.? - ANSWERED: Luigi was not born yet.**

**Mystery B: Why is Luigi opposing Mario in Vs. Wrecking Crew, and absent in Wrecking crew?**

**POTENTIALLY ANSWERED: Because Luigi has some issues with his father. Potentially, Mario Sr. treats children the same way he treats captive animals. In either case, this is no longer contradictory with other facts.**

**Mystery C: Why does Mario suddenly look much younger?**

**ANSWERED: Because this isn’t the same Mario, but his son.**

**Mystery D: Mystery C: Why does Donkey Kong Jr. happily join the Kart racing with Mario and pals?**

**ANSWERED: This isn’t the Mario who oppressed his father. Perhaps they were finding common grounds and making amends between their families?**

It’s all coming together.

When you look at it through this lens, everything makes sense.

Don’t believe me, let’s rapid fire through some more games:

## Mario’s Tennis (1995)

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/Mario%27s\_Tennis.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/Mario%27s_Tennis.jpg)

Once again, Donkey Kong Jr. is happy to hang with Mario Jr. and Luigi. Clearly, they haven’t let their fathers’ enmity get in the way.

## Mario Tennis (1995)

[https://outsidergaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mario-Tennis-Player-Select.jpg](https://outsidergaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mario-Tennis-Player-Select.jpg)

Donkey Kong III joins in the fun. Why does Jr. look and act younger than his son, though? Is this just timey-wimey nonsense?. Baby Mario (Jr.) is here alongside his adult self, so that could explain it, but…

**Mystery E: How does Donkey Kong Jr. look and act younger than Donkey Kong III?**

Donkey Kong III goes on to appear in many, many Mario spinoffs, but these have nothing notable to add to this theory.

## Yoshi’s Island DS. (2006)

[https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616MQCAF11L.\_AC\_SX425\_.jpg](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616MQCAF11L._AC_SX425_.jpg)

Well look at that, here’s Donkey Kong III as a baby, alongside Baby Mario “Super” Mario Jr., confirming the above timey wimeyness of Mario Tennis.

## Mario Vs. Donkey Kong series (various)

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/Mario\_vs.\_Donkey\_Kong\_Coverart.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/Mario_vs._Donkey_Kong_Coverart.png)

This series of game sees Mario Jr. and Donkey Kong III at similar antics to their fathers, but with one very notable difference: Donkey Kong here is acting out of misguided desire, rather than fury and anger. In each and every one, the game ends with an apologetic Donkey Kong being consoled and often presented with a consolation prize.

While Mario Jr. does keep his simian counterpart in check, this is far closer to tough love than it is to enmity.

What about Pauline, though?

If Pauline is Mario’s mother, or at least his father’s former lover, what’s going on here?

Let me ask you simply:

[https://cdn.staticneo.com/w/donkeykong/Pauline.PNG](https://cdn.staticneo.com/w/donkeykong/Pauline.PNG)

[https://mario.wiki.gallery/images/1/11/MKT\_Artwork\_Pauline.png](https://mario.wiki.gallery/images/1/11/MKT_Artwork_Pauline.png)

Do these two look like the same woman to you?

There’s clearly two Paulines. Mario Jr.’s maybe-mother in blonde, and the mayor of New Donk City in brunette.

Let's follow up on that:

## Super Mario Odyssey (2017)

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8d/Super\_Mario\_Odyssey.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8d/Super_Mario_Odyssey.jpg)

Mayor Pauline is here again alongside Mario Jr. and Luigi. Furthermore, New Donk City holds references to both the arcade original and Donkey Kong Country, suggesting that this takes place following Donkey Kong III’s adventures.

We know that Donkey Kong III's adventures have already happened. This means that some of New Donk City's streets were named following these adventures.

Either Mayor Pauline is a different woman from the original Pauline, or enough years have passed for Donkey Kong Sr. has aged enough to become the cantankerous elderly Cranky Kong while Pauline hasn't aged a single day.

The 'two paulines' hypothesis simply works much, much better with the timeline.

This leaves us with just one thorny question to answer:

## Donkey Kong (Gameboy, 1994)

[https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/t\_share/MTc0NDU3MDQzMzI2MTQ5OTky/why-is-dk94-so-genius.png](https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/t_share/MTc0NDU3MDQzMzI2MTQ5OTky/why-is-dk94-so-genius.png)

From the visual presentation, this game undeniably features Donkey Kong III, Mario “Super” Mario Jr., and Mayor Pauline of New Donk City. Furthermore, the ending photo establishes a similar tone to the Mario vs. Donkey Kong game, that all is forgiven.

The question is: That little ape is is acting even more as a subordinate to Donkey Kong III than he did in Mario Tennis. Unlike Mario Tennis, we can’t even assume this is the same baby timewarp phenomenon as with Baby Mario.

Once again, we’re faced with Mystery E.

**Mystery E: How does Donkey Kong Jr. look and act younger than Donkey Kong III?**

I see one possibility here: This Donkey Kong Jr., the same as the one in Mario Tennis (64), is Donkey Kong “Junior” IV, who is named for his grandfather, Donkey Kong ""Junior"" II.

## Conclusion:

I believe we’ve hit every relevant game to scope out data points, and the verdict looks clear to me:

We’re looking at two Marios and four Donkey Kongs.

You might ask, though: What happened to Mario Mario Sr.? Where has he been?

My personal theory:

Getting a little too old for construction work, Mario Mario Sr. decided to go back to school and studied medicine.

[https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ssb/images/1/16/Dr.\_Mario\_-\_Super\_Smash\_Bros.\_Ultimate.png](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ssb/images/1/16/Dr._Mario_-_Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate.png)

Education helped him mellow out and make amends with both his son and the Kong clan. Dr. Mario “Jumpman” Mario Sr. now works as a medical expert, curing viral infections and occasionally joining in the Super Smash Bros. tournament to hang out and duke it out with his children and his old nemesis's successor.",Untangling the Mario and Donkey Kong Timelines - The Two Marios Theory,zwybid
"I found this weird. I don't see why we can't have Custom Robo's 1 and 2 for the American release. Besides translating, it'd just make sense, and it feels off-putting, since with each service, it seemed as if we were getting less exclusives per region, to the point where it seemed we weren't getting any more exclusives per region. But while I kinda understood Custom Robo, Harvest Moon made NO sense. Not only did it ACTUALLY RELEASE IN AMERICA, but Japan got it in SEPTEMBER (aka, when we got nothing, including the ""GoldenEye for 2023"" thing). 

But on the other hand, why didn't Japan get Pokemon Puzzle Leauge? It's Pokemon, and since Japan DIDN'T get Doctor Mario 64, it'd be the ONLY Puzzle game Japan would have, but they just didn't. I get it for NES/SNES, as the games Japan were getting were games Japan would be more interested in, but for crying out loud, why can't American's just play Custom Robo, but why also lock away all the puzzle games from Japan? I just think for the N64 NSO, region exclusives shouldn't be a thing, and the games should just be for all on it","Why are Custom Robo's 1 and 2 exclusive to the Japanese NSO, as well as Harvest Moon 64?

"There's a lot of first party nintendo games that use gyro  for aiming and stuff (splatoon, botw) but it tends to mess up instead of help me. What I've seen people say is that you're supposed to use the stick to aim but gyro for the precise movement. What instead happens to me though is that any little movement of the controller moves the camera wildly about, since the gyro is constant instead of just for aim. What I think would be best would be the gyro being a toggle so that you can aim with the stick and then press a button for the gyro fine-tuning. Why are these games set up like this and how does anyone find it useful?

Yes there has been some good releases like ACNH and Mario Odyssey, but besides that it’s not enough content for all of this time. Both games have been out for a while at this point. Yes there is a lot of ports and indie games, but it’s nothing that makes the switch worth buying over anything else on the market, i’d rather play those games on my console where it would look better in general rather than my switch.

"It’s almost hard to believe that Xenoblade Chronicles, a relatively new Nintendo series, has quickly become such a household name in the JRPG space. The Switch has blessed the world with more entries in this series than any other, and Nintendo assuredly has this IP in their good graces now, much like Fire Emblem. But it wasn’t always sunshine and rainbows. To see how this series fought so hard to get the recognition it rightfully earned, we need to travel back to the twilight years of the Wii era.

The year is 2010. After a strong first few years delivering high quality first party titles, the Wii’s library slowed to a crawl and gave way to more casual games and mountains of shovelware. While there were still a handful of big titles planned for that year like Mario Galaxy 2, Kirby’s Epic Yarn, and Sonic Colors, most of the heavy hitters had come and gone by this point. Meanwhile on the other side of the pond, Japan was priming up its holiday season with a trio of role playing games exclusive to the Wii: The Last Story (developed by the folks behind Lost Odyssey), Pandora’s Tower (developed by a studio primarily known for licensed Shonen Jump titles), and finally Xenoblade Chronicles.

All three games would release in Japan from late 2010 though early 2011. European localizations of all three titles would also be confirmed (courtesy of Nintendo of Europe), and they would all be published by Nintendo in the region. Xenoblade’s director Tetsuya Takahashi was under the impression that the games would naturally all be localized in North America… but that didn’t happen. Nintendo of America stayed tight-lipped on the situation for most of the year, and they even actively stopped Nintendo of Europe from showing off Xenoblade themselves at E3 2011. After seeing all these attempts by NOA to sweep the games under the rug, it was up to the fans… to end the drought.

Born in an IGN message board post in mid-2011, a group of passionate volunteers announced they were galvanizing into a movement to bring more hardcore titles (not just RPGs) to North America. Their campaign, dubbed Operation Rainfall, focused their efforts on the three RPGs already mentioned, and they were damn persistent. They sent emails, signed petitions, and bombarded their Facebook and Twitter accounts demanding that NOA release the games in North America. They even managed to force the Amazon preorder listing for Xenoblade, then only known under its placeholder name “[Monado](https://youtu.be/CPI4WLEQ5as)”, all the way to #1, beating out Ocarina of Time 3D. Another important detail to note was that if Nintendo wasn’t going to publish the games themselves, the campaign would pitch them to another Japanese publisher that would, like Atlus or NIS America. Nintendo did get fans’ hopes up with a generic “never say never” post on Twitter, but didn’t say another word until that holiday season.

Thankfully this story does have a happy ending after all. On December 2, 2011, victory was achieved as Nintendo finally announced that Xenoblade would be released in North America on April 6 as a GameStop exclusive. And this wasn’t the end, as on the same day as its European launch, The Last Story would also be confirmed for North America courtesy of XSeed Games. These two titles finally coming over was a great sign surely, but there was no word of Pandora’s Tower getting an American release. But then out of the blue in early 2013, XSeed Games announced they would publish Pandora’s Tower in the States later that April, much to the campaign’s bewilderment. After nearly two whole years, Operation Rainfall was declared a success, and the original website has since been disbanded. We won.",How Xenoblade Almost Didn’t Make It to America: A Brief History of Operation Rainfall,zv3084

"So my niece and nephew got Switch Lites for Xmas and as I already had one, I decided to look for games that can be played multiplayer online. I've seen some gameplay of Overcooked and thought it would be perfect chaos we could enjoy. So we each bought a copy of Overcooked for $1.99 usd on the eShop. Turns out it doesn't have online multiplayer.

 I decided to look up games on google and ran across Overcooked 2 on a list of online multiplayer games and decided to spend $7 usd to get it and see if it would have multiplayer we could play. Turns out it does and it is great fun.

Then I started to surf the Great Deals section of the eShop, in the 2nd row is both Overcooked 1 and Overcooked 2 right next to each other, but **15 rows** below that, with a smaller Overcooked logo, is Overcooked! All You Can Eat for $9.99 usd that has Overcooked 1 and 2 and all the DLC... 

I would've just bought that first if it was next to the others... I just think its kinda stupid that the first two would be next to each other on the top of the Great Deals section of the eShop and essentially the complete edition is buried further done. Sorry for the rant...

"Hi there.

There was something that always bugged me about Nintendo for a while that I feel I want to talk about, and that's their habit of reusing the same assists and voice clips from some of their games to use in their newer games. What made me talk about this was when Daisy was first introduced in Mario Strikers Battle League where a lot of her voices clips sounded familiar, until I realized that they were ripped from Mario games for the Wii and Wii U. There's also the fact that some characters in the Smash Bros series still use their brawl voice clips as well the Pokemon models from Sword and Shield being reused from the 3ds games. 

I'm not complaining or making a big deal out of this, I'm just really curious as it's starting to becoming a common thing that the Company is starting to do.

One last thing, Nintendo even reuses Character Renders and Artwork from random games. For example, The Amiibo cards from Mario Sports Superstars literally reuses existing artwork, mostly in a bad ""obvious Photoshopped"" way.",Why does Nintendo reused assists and voice clips so much?,zt9i3k

"Everyone wants the Nintendo Switch 2 to have basically the same great features as the original but also have the necessary upgrades for 2023+, ie 2 in 1 console, better graphics, integrated motion controls, OLED screen, 4k output. 

Nintendo...could do that.  But ever since post Gamecube, they've never just ""released"" a successor (sorry ""New"" 3DS doesn't count here) to a flagship system that was the exact same with just relative upgrades.  They want their attention grabbing, headlines capturing flashy gimmick that's gotta pull in the new family casuals.

So what to do after releasing a near perfect console/handheld fusion?  Do all the things listed above but also make it able to support an optional VR mode.  If a new switch is going to support 4K output and high resolution framerate on a portable, what other better way to tie it all in than to offer VR capable device?  I could envision a 3 in 1 extension for the Switch 2 where, much like the Quest VR, the players can game using integrated motion control in addition to playing in handheld or docked.","Calling It: Switch's successor will feature a ""VR"" mode",zsy9ni

But regardless, he was the star of the best selling Xenoblade game at that time, selling nearly 2.5 million copies in total. Rex would go on to receive a Mii costume for Super Smash Bros.

"I dream frequently of top down Zelda, classic side scrolling mario, side scrolling Mega man (classic, x, zero). Top down Final Fantasy/Dragon Quest (All of which have appeared on Nintendo consoles). 

Often if I play my dreams long enough they'll go through some parts of games that I've never seen before, like levels, stages, boss fights, dungeons that aren't in real life.

Sometimes it will be like I'm plugging in this or that old Game cartridge for the SNES or GameBoy and seeing this whole new world open up of games and levels that have never existed, but in the classic greys and greens of the gameboy, or the sprite art of NES or SNES. Sometimes I'll even dream about the 3D worlds from Legend of Zelda and new ways of structuring massive dungeons.

I don't really play games as often as I used to. But it's like some part of me is sad that such a beautiful era is in the distant past. And dreams are essentially creative playgrounds for writing.

What do I do with these dreams? It's tricky trying to describe them in ways that are 'new', but are really just attempts to see old games and worlds in new ways.

I'm not sure what direction these dreams can take me in the real world. I'm just holding onto memories, hoping that when I do step back into the games again, I'll feel a weird feeling of deja vu, not just that I'm remembering a dream, but that the effect carries into living out a dream.

Normally she doesn't notice, and thinks she<s won just for crossing the finish line, but today she noticed something different... the expression on Toadette's face after she crossed the finish line. 

The character does a sort of sniffle with her hand to her eyes, and my daughter realized something was wrong and asked me why she wasn't happy...

So i told her she was just sneezing lol

She still thinks she won, and is happily playing along, but now must think toadette has really bad allergies lol

Nintendo is a VERY child friendly company, so wouldn't it be a good idea to teach children the value of losing with dignity by instead of crying about a loss, they happily clap for the winners? Happy for their success and not upset about their own loss?

I dunno, just a simple little idea. Many of the characters to this clapping animation already, just not when the blatantly lose lol. 

What do you guys think? Would this teach young children sportsmanship? Interested in hearing your opinions and starting a discussion. :)",Losing characters in the Mario Kart series should smile and clap instead of crying. [Idea],zs0v4o

 * ***Kid Icarus*** was released in 1986 for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan.

Play as Pit, a young angel who has been entrusted with a magical bow and arrow. Fight against hordes of enemies that swoop from above and below.

I know nintendo said the ds is discontinued and that the switch was the follow up to it. But I really miss being able to put it in my pocket and play the games I love anywhere and anytime. It would be cool if they could make the ds more modern and up to date with better specs and stuff.

"Imagine something like an Unreal tournament or Half life 2 deathmatch combined with Smash bros. The roster would have 20-25 Nintendo or even third-party characters. Every character would have their own moveset and style of play. For example, Samus would play more like Metroid prime while a character like Link would play more like in links crossbow training.

It would be in a first-person view and would have you fight a 1v1,5v5,10v10 or 20v20 player match. On different maps from different series, (Peaches castle, Hyrule, A pokemon stadium, DK island, etc)

There would also be vehicles players could drive and mount. There would start as small as a skateboard to being able fully to control vehicles like the Arwing, Samus's ship, etc.

There would be upgrades for each character making them stronger via weapons and power-ups at specific points on a map.

Similar to Smash bros. Each new game would add and cut new characters, They would be announced via Reveal trailers.

There would be other game modes. like a sports gamemode or a hide and seek. basically like TF2's style of game modes. And it would have a fully featured stage builder

The game would mainly focus on split screen Co-op but also has online play with 3 different difficulties: light, medium, and hard

And lastly, the game would have a main campaign/Story mode with fully voiced cutscenes

&#x200B;

Edit: I feel like I need to explain the game better

The game is a 3D arena shooter crossover of Nintendo characters set in up to 20v20 battles in different stages/ arenas. The game starts being unique in its unique classes that aren't your standard ""heavy"" ""lightweight"" ""stealth"" and ""engineer"" classes. all characters remain fast and bouncy control-wise but have unique moves, weapons, and upgrades.",An idea I had for a Nintendo arena shooter crossover,zqy4lp

"The Wii has a stigma of being a console with a fruitless controller gimmick and being just for kids and grandparents, on top of the “too much shovelware” schtick that it already gets. But flash forward to today and you’ll see the Wii’s influence everywhere, from VR setups to gyro aiming on more traditional controllers. Like it or not the Wii did change game control for Nintendo forever, even if many didn’t realize it at the time. So let’s look at that for second; what are some amazing first and third party uses of motion controls on Nintendo’s consoles that you can mention? I’ll quickly shout out a couple that I loved right here:

When Nintendo ported GameCube games to the Wii as part of the New Play Control line, we got the definitive versions of Pikmin and Metroid Prime out of it in my opinion. The pointer aiming was seamless and I can’t imagine going back to aiming on a controller for those games. Wario Land Shake It and the Wii exclusive MadWorld are pretty satisfying and visceral displays of gesture controls, as the context for those shakes warranted it and wouldn’t feel as reward with just button mashing. And of course you have gyro aiming, pretty much the only way I can play Ocarina of Time and the Splatoon games nowadays.",What are the best implementations of motion controls on Nintendo consoles in your opinion?,zoyrmi

 * ***Final Fantasy*** was released in 1987 for the Family Computer in Japan. In this role-playing game, developed by *Square*, the world lies shrouded in darkness. The winds die... The sea rages... The earth decays... But the people believe in a prophecy, patiently awaiting its fulfilment. ""When darkness veils the earth, four Warriors of Light shall come..."" After a long journey, four young travellers did at last appear... and in the hand of each was clutched a crystal.

   
   
 * ***Mario Party*** was released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64 in Japan. In this party game, developed by *Hudson Soft*, Mario doesn't spend all his days jumping around and kicking Bowser's behind from here to the moon - he's also the biggest party animal on the face of the Earth. Glimpse how Mario celebrates all the victories he's had over the years with *Mario Party*, a game that - along with its sequels - is unlike any other for the N64, offering some of the system's greatest multiplayer gaming.

   
   
 * ***Pokémon Trading Card Game*** was released in 1998 for the Game Boy Color in Japan. In this digital collectable card game, developed by *Hudson Soft* with *Creatures*, based on the incredibly popular Pokémon Trading Card Game, this Game Boy Color version was a hit with gamers and card collectors alike. Explore the game world to find opponents and gather info. Learn how to build and manage decks, win battles to receive booster packs, then take on the eight Club Masters.

   
   
 * ***Starship Patrol*** (known as ***Starship Defense*** in North America) was released in 2009 for DSiWare in Europe. In this strategy/tower defence game, developed by *Q-Games*, defend your starship fleet from waves of enemy attacks using a combination of strategic skills and resource management.

 * ***Mega Man X*** was released in 1993 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this action/platform game, developed by *Capcom*, when the *Mega Man* series made the technological leap from NES to Super Nintendo, so too did Mega Man himself. Set one hundred years after the original hero's adventures, *Mega Man X* stars a more powerful generation of robot known as X who - along with the maverick Zero - must take on a new threat: the reploids.

   
   
 * ***Mario Party 2*** was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64 in Japan. In this party game, developed by *Hudson Soft*, what do you do when your first party is a raging success? You throw another one, of course! Mario and all of his famous friends have long since RSVP'd for *Mario Party 2*, so you'd be a fool to miss this fiesta. Like the original *Mario Party*, this star-studded sequel allows up to four players to compete in exciting interactive board games packed with surprises.

   
   
 * ***Star Wars Episode I: Racer*** was released in 1999 for the Game Boy Color in PAL territories. In this racing game, developed by *Pax Softnica*, entirely different gameplay from its console and PC counterparts feature. The Game Boy Color hardware is technically incapable of rendering the 3D graphics used in the other versions, so the game was instead based on abbreviated tracks with an overhead 2D view. It also has an additional ""Rumble"" feature, in which a AAA battery may be inserted into the game card to activate vibration.

"Hey folks! I'm a developer who's recently had enough career success to start working on console ports for my games. I'm working on my dream project right now, and I'd like to share it with you all!

The game is called ***Yuma Will Burn***\-

***Yuma Will Burn*** *is an experimental narrative survival game where choices have long-lasting story and mechanical consequences. Harsh survival mechanics exist alongside a dynamically changing narrative in an uncaring and sadistic world of triage, poverty, and fear.*

(Only page up is Steam currently): [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma\_Will\_Burn/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma_Will_Burn/)

As a developer, I've taken a risk by dedicating so much time to a game of this type. The genre is VERY obscure and niche. I still did it though,  because I believe in both the artistic value of a deep and involving narrative experience and the unbridled passion some have for it.

"I dunno if this is the right place to post this but I just had to get this out. While Odyssey seems much more like what I should enjoy especially considering I always had such a fun time with 64 (never tried sunshine), 3d world is just plainly more enjoyable for me, and most of the complains levied against it, especially the bland art style one, are kind of unjust as the game does have a fair amount of variety, at the very least comparable to the galaxy games, it's almost like no one actually has played it but just complain about it because popular people do. Now, don't get me wrong, Odyssey is fun, but it just feels too bloated and somehow.. bland to me?

"I’ve been playing a lot of Punch Out Wii lately, and to say it’s a fantastic revival of a long dormant IP would be an understatement. I would put it up there with Killer Instinct, Mortal Kombat 9, and Strider 2014 as one of the best faithful reboots out there. Nintendo has revived plenty of dormant franchises over the years, starting as early as the GameCube release of Metroid Prime and Fusion and going all the way to today with Nintendo Switch Sports and Advance Wars (eventually… fingers crossed).

Looking back, Nintendo really went ham on reviving dormant IPs in the Wii era. Along with Punch Out, we got Sin and Punishment, Donkey Kong Country, Kirby, and Excitebike all within the span of 2 years.

I’m gonna quickly spotlight three franchise revivals that I enjoyed and helped elevate their respective series to the next level, two of which coincidentally being on 3DS. Let’s start with [Fire Emblem Awakening](https://youtu.be/n-BB3KbVUYI); this game came out in the wake of continuously declining sales of the franchise. The devs were given an ultimatum to have their next game sell well or else they’d be sleeping with the F-Zero developers. Needless to say it was a massive success, with four mainline entries, a successful mobile game, and a ton of spinoffs ever since.

Wario Land was a series that was defined by its surreal scenarios and handheld only nature,  as it made a name for itself on the Game Boy and GBA. But for seven years after Wario Land 4, we got nothing. Eventually Nintendo and developer Good Feel expressed a desire to revive the series for the Wii, and they did so with a striking hand drawn artstyle and a few anime cutscenes. This was [Wario Land Shake It](https://youtu.be/2r_AYT1FUYg), or The Shake Dimension in Europe, and… it unfortunately didn’t sell well at all. This meant that Wario would be stuck in the microgame factory while Good Feel continued to collaborate with Nintendo on other series like Kirby and Yoshi.

Finally we have to mention [Kid Icarus Uprising](https://youtu.be/WGR8wXl4QTM). After the first two 8 bit adventures, the series went dark for almost 20 years. But after Pit’s inclusion in Brawl, Masahiro Sakurai took it upon himself to revive the franchise on his own accord. And the result was one of the best games you could find on the 3DS. It’s an amazing blend of cinematic action, character writing, and content. And for a dead series of all things! Please just… play Uprising if you haven’t, especially if you enjoyed the characters’ banter in Smash’s Palutena Guidance conversations.",Favorite Nintendo franchise revivals?,zkj15q

"I don't remember when exactly this happened but I'm guessing sometime in 1991. The super NES was just released and the super Mario super show had a live contest that ran for a month or two. At some point during the show they would scroll text saying to call this 1 800 number and win a free SNES.

Being from a poor background, I really wanted to win one. So I watched and called every weekday. The time to call was different each time. But when it appeared I would call. It would ring a few times and auto hanged up. So I would just try calling again and again.

Then about 3 weeks in... It happened guys... A lady answered. I asked if I won the SNES and she said yes. I started screaming to my older sister that I got threw. Then it AUTO HANGED UP! I didn't get crap. I kind of recalled the lady chuckling when she said yes .. like she knew it was gonna hang up on me. I was crushed.

So did anyone win a SNES? Was it all a scam to get ratings up? Such a mean thing to do to kids...

Please share any experience you had with this. If it helps I live in the US and don't know if the contest was held in other countries.

2. Zelda (also obvious)

Animal Crossing? NH Sold way too much and it's basically mainstream now, I know many people who bought the switch just for AC:NH

Kirby? Forgotten Land was really good

Pikmin? Least likely, imo

Metroid? I don't think it's as big (I could be wrong)

Splatoon is popular but I don't want to include a multiplayer entry in the Big 3.

Mario Kart, Smash etc are crossover titles. Things like wario, Luigi's mansion, captain Toad, Donkey Kong, yoshi, Mario sports etc are spinoffs so They are disqualified.

Fire Emblem and Xenoblade are kinda Niche.

Star Fox and F-Zero are practically dead unless Nintendo revives them.

"I held off on snagging Link's Awakening due to a massive backlog of games I needed to get through first. While I didn't play them all, I did make a serious dent and felt it was time so I snagged my copy yesterday evening.

I stated playing and immediately fell in love with the art style. I didn't think I was going to like it as much as I do but the performance of the game itself is shockingly terrible at times. I tried lowering my resolution as low as it would go thinking that might help but it did nothing. There are clear framerate drops every time I exit one location to another. It lasts only a few seconds but it's consistent. I hopped on Google to see about some kind of fix and was shocked to see people mentioning this in threads on forums 3 years ago. I hadn't heard anything about this issue. From what I could find from reading, apparently the engine is dropping from 60fps to 30fps due to memory limitation? 

While it doesn't render the game unplayable, I'm just a bit shocked that Nintendo would release this like it is, but more-so that they haven't addressed it with a patch of some kind after all these years. Plenty of games run at 30fps just fine so if it's a complicated bug fix or simply undo-able, why not release a menu toggle that locks the game to 30fps? It's not an ideal solution but the consistent jumping between the two framerates makes it feel like I purchased an unfinished game rather than the console selling title that the Zelda franchise is.",Just purchased Link's Awakening yesterday..,zhu5o3
"Many Nintendo fans seem to have to stuck to the idea that the Switch will be our only Nintendo console until 2027. This is because Nintendo has said on multiple occasions that they plan on supporting it for a decade. I, personally, think there has been a huge misinterpretation here. I'll try and explain. Let's take the 3DS for example. The 3DS had a lifespan of 9 years. However, in its 6th year, the Switch was released. The 3DS was never considered ""dead"" when the Switch came out. Its discontinuation in 2020 marked the end of its lifespan. So, based on this, I'd say the switch won't be the only console between now and 2027. It would be unwise of Nintendo to release a console, immediately discontinue the switch and then have nothing to fall back on. So, they could release their next console, keep the Switch alive for a few years until it finds its footing, and then discontinue it when it's no longer needed. Or, alternatively, if their next console does badly, they could have the switch as a backup system. They've done this with every console they've released.

"For the past 5 years or so, Nintendo has dabbled with the incredibly lucrative “gacha” business model. This has been a phenomenon that has permeated the games industry for well over a decade now, bolstered by such successful Japanese properties as Granblue Fantasy, Fate Grand Order, and most recently Genshin Impact. Other Japanese publishers like Square Enix and Bandai Namco have also taken notice and developed similar games to capitalize on this model.

Modeled after a Japanese toy capsule vending machine, a typical gacha game is usually free to play, but offers in app purchases for more chances to obtain rarer goods via a random roll of the dice. Nintendo has primarily done this with their mobile games, namely Fire Emblem Heroes (which was stupidly successful), Dragalia Lost (rest in peace), and Mario Kart Tour (which only just removed gacha a while back). But also they dabbled with gacha in their console games like Xenoblade Chronicles 2, as new Blades are obtained via this same system.

Gacha systems have frequently been compared to lootboxes in AAA western games like Star Wars Battlefront 2 and Overwatch. Certain governments around the world have even [recognized gacha games as a form of gambling](https://youtu.be/7ETC2OHGDhA) under the law and have taken measures to regulate them. But what do you think about them? Do you enjoy Nintendo’s handling of them? Or are they just more of the same thing in your eyes?

"Don't get me wrong; there's a lot to like about Sunshine. The entire concept of Mario going on vacation to a tropical island is actually pretty unique in the Mario canon. The graphics look amazing even 20 years later, and I would argue Mario's controls are the smoothest they've ever been in this game. 

But the thing that keeps me from wanting to play this game again? The blue coins. Dear god do those blue coins grind my gears. 

I have played through this game to 100% completion dozens of times, I still need to look up several locations, and mind you, this is with the modern luxury of being able to YouTube stuff instantly, back in 2002 you would need to buy a strategy guide. A lot of them are in places you would never in a million years think to look, like spraying an INCREDIBLY SPECIFIC part of a wall or spraying something for a long time. And the worst part is it's not just a few of them, there's several on each level that there's no way you'd be able to find without some kind of outside resource.

There's so much to enjoy about this game, but this mechanic seriously weighs down the replay value of the game. Anyone else have thoughts on this?","Been replaying Mario Sunshine lately, and there's one thing that bogs this game down for me big time.",zfq24x

Iwata expressed interest in video games from an early age and created his first simple game while in high school. In June 2014, a tumour in Iwata's bile duct was discovered during a routing physical exam. It was removed, and Iwata returned to work in October of that year. The problem resurfaced in 2015, and Iwata died at the age of 55 from its complications on July 11. Members of the gaming industry and fans alike offered tributes through public announcements and social media, and fans worldwide established temporary memorials.

"Star link: battle for Atlas is a 6/10 videogame with a lot of problems, and it's also a great template for what to do with the future of the star fox franchise. Star link is a game with one major problem; it's suffering from a lack of content. If Nintendo actually gave Ubisoft Toronto a budget they might be able to make a really good game with the foundations of Star link.



Star link lacks content: this isn't a controversial take. In the game there are seven planet where you do the same 6 things. The game has a few different missions with base liberation/building, guarding a spot for a set amount of time, exploration, and puzzle solving. The biggest problem is there's so much of the same things to do that after a little while it all blends together, not to mention that three of the activities blend together with little in the way of variety. The ideas are great, but the problem lays in the fact that you have to do the same activities 280 times. In a real star fox game the solution to this problem is simple; add more content more missions, more variety in combat and introducing more gameplay options latter in the game to spice things up. More variety would go along way in things feeling less like doing a check list.



On a similar not the entire game lacks character and story. The crew of Star Fox is great but the story and other characters suck. You can have an amazing character but when they're trying to have conversations with drywall they are going to be lacking. Too many of the characters in star link had no personality. In a future Star Fox game I'd hope that they would make better side characters to give the cast more to work with in terms of backstory and lore.



Speaking of characters the lack of unique bosses and enemies really hurt the game. Most of the game lacks personality and with the lack of variety it creates a death spiral where you go to a planet and fight the same boring boss, then do the same boring boring missions where you talk to the same boring characters. Unique bosses and changing up the core gameplay loop is a must. Fighting the same bosses gets boring real fast. In a proper Star Fox game having more unique bosses that need different tactics to take them down would be a good first step in helping to freshen things up. After that maybe having to not fight the same bad guy the same way on every planet all the time would go a long way in not feeling the drag of doing the same thing with a change of wallpaper.



Star link gets a lot right the missions are good, the flying is fun, the weapons are all unique and offer real tangible benefits to using one offer the other. Where the game struggles is the lack of content outside of the combat and then spreading that content out over seven planets. Like I said, star link is a 6/10 videogame, but all the pieces are there to make a really good video game if the crew at Ubisoft Toronto are given a chance to reflect at what went wrong and fix the few problems that are there.",Star link should be the future of Star Fox,zdl377

I think Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an obvious candidate. The Wii U got an application called ""Animal Crossing Plaza"" in 2013, which had HD models of lots of Animal Crossing characters. Then in 2015, Amiibo Festival came out as a spin-off game. I think Amiibo Festival was likely created due to Nintendo delaying the next main series game to the NX/Switch, and so they rushed out a cheap spin-off game using HD assets they had already made.

Kirby Star Allies is another game I think may have been planned for the Wii U. The Wii U got a spin-off in Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, but it did not get a mainline traditional Kirby game. Star Allies was probably planned to release on Wii U, but moved to Switch and was released only 12 months after the Switch's launch.",Luigi's Mansion 3 began its development on the Wii U.

"You know how they make updated remakes of the games? I would love to see a new updated version of Nintendo DS as next console.

I’m too young (2003) and too non-American to witness DS era myself. I have never used Pictochat, flipchat, download play or Street plaza myself. All of them seems to be very social and evoking creativity, and that’s what im looking in gaming consoles. 

Playing Mario Kart or New super Mario Bros. DS with your friends via shared play, communicating with drawings, walking around with your DS in public place and founding out there are many DS users just like you (and even having their Mii arriving to your console) all this sounds like a LOT of fun.

Also DS had tons of good and unique games, and some of them are best entries in the series to this day (at least to my opinion). I think the current Nintendo approach should switch from single player Playstation-like focus to social and creative one. What do you think? If you witnessed DS era, was it like I’m imagining? Would you like to have this again?",I would love to see an updated Nintendo DS as next handheld console,zc31pv

"When I first played Luigi’s mansion dark moon (it was the first one I had access to) I was pleasantly surprised by how fun the game was. When I played all the other Luigi’s mansion games a was still blown away each and every time, but it is beginning to get a little repetitive. So I have a new idea.

Basically King boo escapes in some way and instead of being bound to a mansion he can finally roam the world. Luigi and friends have to go on an adventure around the world visiting various kingdoms to find and stop him before he controls the world. 

The game can have many playable characters: 
Luigi
Mario
Wario
Waluigi
Bowser
Toad 
Peach
And a game specific character

I think it could be a neat game and was wondering what other people thought of the idea.","There needs to be another Luigi’s mansion game, but a little different this time.",zc2r6q

 * The ***64DD*** was released in 1999 in Japan. A magnetic disk drive peripheral for the Nintendo 64 developed by *Nintendo* with *Alps Electric*. It was originally announced in 1995, prior to the Nintendo 64's 1996 launch. The ""64"" references both the Nintendo 64 console and the 64 MB storage capacity of the disks, and ""DD"" is short for ""disk drive"" or ""dynamic drive"". New genres of games were developed due to the advent of 64DD's rewritable mass storage, real-time clock (RTC), and Internet appliance functionality. However, the system's commercial failure required many 64DD games to be released on traditional cartridges alone, ported to other consoles, or cancelled. Some of these standalone Nintendo 64 cartridge releases include the equivalent of the 64DD's RTC chip directly on board the cartridge, as with Japan's *Animal Forest*. The 4MB RAM Expansion Pak became a sometimes mandatory staple of Nintendo 64 game development, being packaged along with a few cartridge games. All subsequent Nintendo consoles would directly include RTC functionality.

"A thing that a lot of people talk about during this week is the second mario movie trailer, because on top of looking really nice, it also has tons of references, and one of those references came from the mario vs donkey kong fight in the form of mario's first attack pose which gave strong smash vibes, and that made me realize that I needed to make this post.
A lot of people are expecting a smash bros movie if nintendo continues to make movies about their IPs, but in my opinion, that would be a mess. Super smash bros has never shined because of campaigns, but it had 2 different stories, and both of them sucked, the first one had a lot of plotholes and the second one didn't even try. My guess is that since the roster is full of faces from Nintendo and videogames's history, it would be disrespectful if only some characters get the spotlight more than others, but when you don't have a focus for the story, what ends up happening is that you don't understand anything. Smash bros tried with subspace a story with no actual protagonist and that broke the fluency of the story, then they tried to make mini stories in the character reveal trailers were the newcomer was the focus and that worked, in fact, it worked so well that in ultimate they didn't even tried to make a story for world of light.
But obviously, Nintendo knows it would be a shame if their characters didn't cross up, so maybe they plan to make something else, and I have a theory about it.
I'm sure very few people know who Kevin Keene/Captain N is, this was Nintendo's very first attempt at a crossover, someone that appeared out of nowhere in Nintendo Power's magazines and then got a tv show and comic, said tv show sucked, but the comic is decent. Keeping in mind that Captain N is a Nintendo of America character, and in the end they are the ones who contact universal and therefore have more power than Nintendo of Japan when it comes to movies, maybe we will see Kevin get a redemption.
But that's my guess, I want to read yours down below.","If the NCU ends up being a reality, I don't think a smash bros movie is that likely",za80zy

"Ok so here’s my theory regarding why they’ve been so tight lipped about who Charles Martinet is playing in the Mario movie and why they’re no addressing any of the Chris Pratt voice complaints.  

Chris Pratt is playing Mario Jr., son of Mario Sr., voiced by Charles Martinet. 

I’ve got what I think is some pretty compelling evidence too, and I think this is going to be a huge part of the plot. I’ll get into the evidence as my general story layout unfolds. 

The story:
I believe the movie is going to open up with Bowser or one of his henchmen kidnapping Mario Sr. from our world. At this point, Mario Sr. is an old man who’s already been on dozens of adventures, namely all the games from the 80’s and 90’s. He’s too weak to fight back (not that this would matter since he’s been kidnapped loads of times even in good health,) but this would explain why Bowser in the first trailer is so convinced when he says “Now who’s going to stop me!” It’s because he’s already kidnapped Mario. 

We then cut to Mario and Luigi running their plumbing business in NYC when their dad goes missing. Mario finds a way into the mushroom kingdom through some weird magical plumbing system and discover soon that this is where Mario Sr is being held by Bowser. I think Luigi will probably stumble in on his own, or might even be collected separately by Bowser’s henchmen, thus why he seems clueless about everything. 

The majority of the movie will revolve around Mario uniting the Mushroom Kingdom and all his Allie’s to rescue Luigi and his father. That’s why we get Princess Peach looking like a warrior as well. They have a common goal to stop Bowser. For them, it’s about the Star, but for Mario it’s about his family. 

So that’s why Mario Sr. will be Charles Martinet. He’s going to be the immigrant 1980’s Mario. Mario Jr. will be Pratt, more New Yorker than Italian, having grown up in NYC. I don’t think it’s a stretch that Mario would name his kid Mario, after all, his name is Mario Mario anyway. 

TLDR: Martinet is going to be OG Mario, Pratt is OG Mario’s son.",My Charles Martinet Theory for new Mario movie:,za4xro

"I’m curious how many new Nintendo consoles (both home and portable) everyone here has owned. By this, I mean you purchased the console when it was new to the market (NOT years later when it was no longer in production and it had become “retro”). 
I’m sure many will have collected older consoles that existed before their time, or which they didn’t get new, but those don’t count… I’m wondering what consoles people owned when they were first on the market and why, and also why you may have skipped some consoles along the way.

Personally, I suppose my first new Nintendo console was the Donkey Kong Game and Watch handheld. My brother and I played that endlessly and I still have it.
In the early 80s, I also had a Commodore 64 and did plenty of home gaming on it, so we didn’t have an NES, but my friends and neighbors had the NES, which intrigued me enough that i got into other Nintendo games and saved up for an original Game Boy that I bought from the electronics and watches counter at K-Mart in 1989.
My roommate in college had an SNES that we played all the time and then we bought an N64 together. I also had gotten a Game Boy Advance and then a Game Cube around this time. 
I was really into the handhelds so I got a GBA SP too and then the DS right when they both came out.
I also got a Wii around this time and had many years of playing on it.

"Hear me out. In my opinion, as an owner of both, the 3DS has more great first party stuff than the Switch, and the third party offerings are more interesting in a lot of cases. Aside from BOTW, Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the Switch entries in a lot of storied franchises fell flat for me. Mario Golf for Switch sucks, Mario Kart 8 is inferior to 7 IMO and I didn't like the Switch Warioware or Smash Bros. entries at all. As far as updated repros go, we get very few on Switch. Link's Awakening is the standout and really there isn't a whole hell of a lot else. On 3DS there's 3D versions of Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask and Starfox 64.

As for third party stuff on Switch, we have a bunch of indie stuff of varying quality (getting to App Store levels of oversaturation tho) and anemic, buggy as hell ports of stuff like No Man's Sky and X-Com 2. The third party stuff on 3DS includes some really cool things, like Sega's amazing 3D ports of their classic superscaler games from the 80s.

"I completely understand if you didn’t know about this game or just don’t care. This was Nintendo’s fourth major attempt at breaking into the mobile game market after Super Mario Run, Fire Emblem Heroes, and Animal Crossing Pocket Camp. And it was pretty successful for itself, grossing over $167 million dollars in revenue and at one point being the company’s second biggest mobile success after Fire Emblem.

[Dragalia Lost](https://youtu.be/nb6H3EivKcc) was an action RPG co-developed with Cygames, the Japanese company probably best known for creating the hit mobile game Granblue Fantasy. It’s a similar high-fantasy setting with tons of kingdoms, dragons, swords and sorcery, the whole kit and caboodle. And it’s a gacha game too, so you had to summon dragons and characters with resources you gathered in game or by buying them outright with real money. There were even a few special collaboration events with Mega Man, Monster Hunter, Persona 5, and Fire Emblem. It should come as no surprise that this game took off the way it did, just like Fire Emblem Heroes before it.

It was apparently one of the more forgiving gacha games people have experienced with how generously it handled its in-game currency, and it’s cultivated a passionate fanbase over the years. But the main reason I’m bringing this up today is that…. as of this writing, the game set to officially shut down tomorrow after an impressive 4 years of service. For being a brand new IP going toe-to-toe with some of Nintendo’s top dawgs, this game did really well for itself. Rest in peace little guy, you did good.","What do people here think of Dragalia Lost, probably Nintendo’s most successful new IP since Splatoon?",z7ue3z

"Hey guys! This sub has been melting down over Pokemon SV's percevied lack of quality. But I've personally really enjoyed them so far, I've gotten 4 badges and done 3 Starfall Streets/Titans and I have to say that these are the best, most enjoyable Pokemon games I've ever played. Yes there are performance issues, but really the occasional frame rate drop isn't that big of a deal to me. 

The main thing I like is the open world, I've always been more focused on catching them all and Pokemon SV makes it easy to wonder around and look for new Pokemon (new Pokemon whose designs I think are really good for the most part), walking around and seeing the Pokemon in their habitats feels way more immersive then running around having to get in like 20 encounters to make sure I've got everything.

I'm also a fan of EXP candies. I remember *hating* having to grind in SoulSilver and Diamond to beat the E4, it was annoying, slow and did not make me have a closer bond to my Pokemon. Now I can just do some Tera raids and boom, now I'm at the level I want. The music is also great too.

"Over the course of the last decade, beginning with the 3DS and Wii U era, Nintendo has finally gotten into the game of offering new content post launch. And while stuff like the modern Mario sports games may spur your opinion on Nintendo with DLC, truth be told they have offered some of the finest quality DLC we’ve seen in the modern gaming landscape. Here are four big first party games (besides Smash and Mario Kart obviously) that I feel do paid DLC incredibly well in no particular order.

**1. [Xenoblade Chronicles 2](https://youtu.be/6kMHFFpZfX0):** Probably the single best season pass Nintendo has ever put out, and it just goes to show which of their development subsidiaries is truly superior to the rest. Xenoblade 2’s expansion pass includes new Blades and Blade quests, new costumes, a new Challenge Mode with its own unique set of rewards, and most important an entire prequel campaign in Torna: The Golden Country. I spent over 110 hours in the base game and just under 20 hours in Torna, and the latter was everything I wanted Breath of the Wild’s story DLC to be. And that gut punch of an ending hoo boy.

**2. [Pokemon Sword and Shield](https://youtu.be/bKD_nASppNk):** The Pokemon Company is finally embracing a more modern content delivery. Goodbye third versions, direct sequels and expanded re-releases, and hello paid DLC! Okay to be real for a sec, the launch period of this game was rough, but to many people this DLC actually saved the game for them. I never played the games myself to form a definitive opinion on them, but that’s the general vibe I got from the reception.

**3. [Fire Emblem Awakening](https://youtu.be/8kTawTYxWlc):** This was supposed to be Fire Emblem’s last gasp before dying a slow and painful death…. but thankfully it wasn’t. And with its unprecedented success came large amounts of paid DLC maps. There are maps for farming experience and money, maps for obtaining rare weapons and classes, maps for recruiting legacy FE characters into your party, and finally story focused maps that expand on the world of the base game. What I especially like about these DLC maps is that they don’t necessarily detract from the main adventure like how Fates and Echoes did. You can just pick and choose which ones you want to get; you didn’t need to buy it all. I mean I did because of course.

**4. [Mario Golf World Tour](https://youtu.be/dm2K7lkZxqI):** This is one that I especially want to call attention to, as it is way more important to the history of Nintendo’s DLC practices than you may realize. Mario Golf World Tour’s DLC lineup is hugely important because it was the very first time Nintendo had ever done a season pass…. ever. This actually scared quite a lot of people back in early 2014, as Nintendo and season passes didn’t really have any history with each other, but it did get people talking about potential DLC for the upcoming Mario Kart 8 and Smash 4. As for the DLC itself, it was actually fantastic! It added 4 new characters, 6 new golf courses, tons of Mii costumes, and over 100 extra challenges for the in-game challenge mode. It’s all great stuff. What happened Camelot?",Nintendo games with the best DLC offerings in your opinion?,z59vm0

"Hey 👋 just wanted to share I’m [22F] feeling particularly nostalgic today.

"I got a new switch today and the Joy Con holder does not even have a charge port. This serves so many purposes for Nintendo and they are all bad for the end-users.

2. Creates enormous amounts of e-waste
3. Makes the user rely on the functionality of the Switch to charge the joy-cons.

Im incredibly saddened that Nintendo has chosen this path for their products where now I feel they are becoming the new EA of the gaming industry, adding to climate change and degrading the quality of experience this fan has come to expect. I can understand as a cost saving measure, that a charge port on a critical component might not get much use, but this creates so many potential frustrating situations for users the only explanation for this design choice was to increase sales and was in fact approved by Nintendo executives themselves.",Joy Con Holder doesn't have charge port.

"Like many others, I have found the technical issues with the new Pokemon to be too aggravating, distracting, and frankly insulting to ignore.

So I requested a refund for my digital purchase, hearing that they sometimes make exceptions to their no refund policy.

I was told no. So, I asked again, expressing my disappointment, that the game is in an unacceptable state to the extent that it feels insulting, and that, as a lifelong Nintendo fan, I don't feel as inclined to buy from a company I feel disrespected by in the future.

So they said they would escalate the request to the relevant department.

Great, it looks like we're getting somewhere! After all, I've Ioved Nintendo my whole life, nobody actually wants to stop buying their games over something like this.

Another email: We have a strict no refund policy. Please try restarting your system, reinstalling the game, changing your micro SD card; time wasting stuff that we all know won't work. The rep apologises for my problems with Pokemon Violet. I had bought Scarlet. Maybe they didn't read my previous emails?

So I restate how I feel. Only this time, something unexpected happens. I feel more like I mean it. Might I actually never buy a product from Nintendo again over this? If they insist on disrespecting their customers? If that good will is worth the £50? If they really want to attach their reputation to this game?

A new email. ""We are sorry, but we are unable to provide a different decision, your comments have been passed on to the relevant departments.""

So, it's really no.

When I first said I may not buy from Nintendo again, I wasn't expecting to end up meaning it.

"Excuse me but, I need to inform you that Pokémon is currently the biggest laughing stock in the internet. The stain this horrible studio is leaving in the Nintendo's family is growing year after year (I know they don't own the majority of GF but Nintendo has made everything to relate the IP to the brand so idc for that statement).

We are at the point that even Call of Duty is a more respected name than Pokémon in the industry and has delivered better products this year than Game Freak has done in the entire console's life; you know what? even before that. Trust me, if this game was made by someone like Ubisoft or Sonic Team you wouldn't be hesitant AT ALL to bitch both the developers AND the publisher.

I won't be surprised AT ALL if the next generation ends up being a Cyberpunk/Fallout 76 level of disaster and Pokémon fans still show they are at FIFA/Madden followers level of conformism.

 * ***Fusajiro Yamauchi*** was born in 1859. A Japanese entrepreneur who founded the company that is now known as *Nintendo*. Yamauchi lived in Kyoto, Japan and had a wife and a daughter, Tei Yamauchi (who later married future *Nintendo* president and Fusajiro Yamauchi's successor, Sekiryo Kaneda). On November 6, 1889, Fusajiro Yamauchi opened the first ""Hanafuda"" (flower cards) card shop called ""*Nintendo Koppai*"" during a time when the Japanese government was banning playing cards from the hands of the public, due to them being tied to gambling, with the exception of Yamauchi's playing cards. With the huge success he had in selling these cards, he rapidly began expanding and opened another card shop in Osaka. He later went on to create more cards. Fusajiro departed from the company in 1929, leaving his son-in-law Sekiryo Kaneda (whose name had changed to Sekiryo Yamauchi) in charge of the company. In the next eleven years Fusajiro remained out of the business until he had a stroke, which led to his death on January 1, 1940.

,Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is the second biggest Pokémon launch of all time | UK Boxed Charts,z0m129
"Pokémon Violet  


Context: I am a AAA game developer with nearly 20 years experience in the games industry making some of the biggest games on the planet, and as such feel I have a pretty stable viewpoint of this polarising games reception.

I have put in around 40 hours since Friday and rolled credits last night. Now I will start with the tech issues and negatives before we end on a VERY high note. The game is technically a garbage pile in terms of code and stability. I know I know, it's Pokemon so it brings joy and warmth but it's a very buggy mess with constant rolling memory leaks which can easily be replicated. Graphical glitches regularly break immersion, and here is an overview of ones I got on a regular basis:

* NPC's walking through cutscenes and just standing inside other characters while they talk
* NPC's faces coming off and floating around the screen
* Frame rates constantly sub-24 - This is not a point of WAAA NOT 60FPS OMG, this is a level of frame rate that triggers nausea and vomiting in a lot of players as the instability causes motion sickness. This is a known pitfall in development and you should ALWAYS prevent a game from rolling under 24FPS, with wild fluctuations as quite simply put, your audience will literally vomit
* LoD priorities are essentially none. LoD (load on demand) is the feature that games use to prioritise loading of assets and tech on screen to avoid overloading your buffers and crashing/dropping performance. This game has essentially 0 LoD priority setup so the game is just wild on what you can and can't see/interact with at any one time
* Lighting/shadows is abysmal at times in that in some areas you will feel like you are under a spotlight, and others you wont see a thing. Shadows are heavily broken too and often load as paint splodges with heavy pixelation
* Crashes are constant and easily replicateable. The main one is while playing online, you have a roughly 1 in 5 chance of crashing when entering the Sandwich shops or restaurants
* Body horror rigging issues across the board where NPC's and playable characters are contorted and twisted in horrific shapes because their animation rigging is poorly built and not optimised at all. To give you some insight into this, every movement is applied to a rig (a skeleton) for an NPC or character, and that rig decides on how the animations are limited in terms of ""can a knee bend backwards"" etc. When animations get added to different places they still reference the same rig they were built on, and if that rig changes, the animations referencing it can go insane if not checked and QA'd
* Models and textures not loading or only loading super low res variants even in cinematics
* Various other smaller glitches and bugs that destroy immersion

So that's the tech side, and I cannot say anything other than the tech is garbage. If this was a game of the year contender (it isn't right now) this would be the part that made it an instant no on deciding that as technically the game fails on nearly every front. This is an OBJECTIVE (factual) view of the tech, not SUBJECTIVE (opinion/emotional).

Now onto the games music. It slaps. It's great at multiple points and constantly feels like a bop. There was only one point (which covers roughly 7 hours of gameplay too) where it needed addressing and that's doing the lessons in the school. You get the same loop played over and over and within a few minutes I hated that track because it felt like I was being drowned in the same few bars of music. Contrast to that the final act music pieces including the final encounters are awesome, but slightly less epic than things like the final encounter with Necrozma in Sun/Moon, Eternatus in Sw/Sh and Dialga in Legends: Arceus. Can't really fault any of the music other than the lessons bit above, top tier stuff here.

Right, so that brings us to the games storyline. Oof. OOOOF.

It starts out with you being the same old 10 year old only now you are in PokéSpain, but instead of being sent down a pretty linear path, you get the keys to the open world and are told to go explore it, which for the most part you do. I did find the open progression frustrating at points as without level scaling or any notification of level requirements, I found myself doing encounters that WAY over or under levelled me. Simple map markers suggesting level ranges or even adding level scaling would solve this. Anyways, I digress. The storyline is AWESOME! It ramps up through 3 sub stories, all with impact and a great ending feeling like you have really done some good to this world and they culminate in unlocking Act 4 which has been teased throughout by leaving a big blue splodge in the centre of the map, and do I mean BIG. You build up to understanding there is something bad happening in the crater and the professor has been preparing you to travel into the space to help them (him or her depending on your game version). You get a great ramp up into descending the crater and are then greeted with what I can only describe as the Great Plateau in terms of size and scale of a new zone which has great music, ambience and constant danger as you descend into the Sci-fi madness of the ending, and the ending WAY outshines all previous Pokémon games, and subjectively I would say beats a lot of JRPG's too. I had to take a moment on completion to contemplate all the stuff the game threw at me in the final act and it would be here where the Game of the Year contender would come back into play. The ending goes HARD and the build up is meaty, wonderful and mostly without over the top exposition. Like every conversation has meaning and impact and it was just glorious, opening the door to massive endgame and huge potential for more to come in DLC.

The character design is beautiful, and while the game does flow a tonne of them at you, each one has cool and well explained backstory and beautiful art styles, the standout for me being the red lady (who's name escapes me) from Team Star with the massive boots and bizarre walking animation. Seconded is the Electric Gym Leader who on reveal I thought looked horribly irritating and twee, but when I interacted and did that section I thoroughly enjoyed it.

So here it is, the game being in it's current state is not a contender for anything other than average rewards but if they fix the tech issues to a level where your immersion is unaffected, we definitely have the best Pokémon game in the mainline series. Objectively the game is terribly made and clearly was made for higher performing hardware but subjectively, it's a AAA gold bar.

"I was going to buy Pokémon Scarlet to play with my young stepson, who is VERY excited for Violet, but by mistake I accidentally bought Violet instead from the eShop. I knew my stepson would be disappointed that he wouldn't be able to get the exclusive Mons from Scarlet, so even though the eShop TOS indicates that refunds aren't allowed, I went ahead and talked with their customer support and explained the situation. The employee was able to work with me, and after a day, got me a refund! It meant a lot to me, but it'll mean more to my stepson. Thanks, Customer Support!

"I'm having more fun in Pokémon Scarlet than I've had with any main line Pokémon game in a long time. They really did just tell you what you needed to know and then let you go do whatever you want. And that's exactly what a Pokémon game should do. I ignore the map completely so I can just explore everything in the game, and then I just happen upon the main quest items as I go. On top of that, the new Pokémon introduced have been some of my favorites. The sense of adventure i am getting from this game is precisely the thing that got me hooked on the franchise back in red/blue as a child. In other words, it has everything I could ask from the game, and I am fully satisfied with my purchase.

But I want to bring to light another part of the equation that leads so many fans to share their hatred of the games on the internet. Pokémon is made for kids. Little kids. The core audience is young children that play games like Roblox, Fortnite, Minecraft etc. As fans grow up, and their tastes change, they often resent Game Freak for continuing to make games with weak graphics and immediately assume its laziness and not a design choice. Little kids love Pokémon. The fact that you don’t like the game could mean that game freak sucks, or it could mean that your tastes changed. If you don’t like the game, don’t buy it. I’m just tired of everyone assuming they know better than GF and Nintendo. “They are so lazy”.

"Weird question? Probably yeah, but I find it interesting to bring up. I think I have a unique perspective when it comes to these two specific franchises. I didn’t really branch out to other Nintendo franchises until the Wii U era, and I mainly bought that console for Smash. I saw Shulk’s moveset with the Monado arts and thought it was super cool and fun to play, so I wanted to find out more about this character. That’s how I stumbled into the Xenoblade series, and I finally got to play the first game when it came out on the Wii U Virtual Console. After falling in love with that, I followed the Xenoblade series up to the present day, owning every entry in some form.

I didn’t get into Zelda until the Switch era, and my first proper jump into the franchise was with Breath of the Wild. I adored the open world gameplay of both it and Xenoblade, and that makes sense given that Monolith Soft helped out massively on this game. But now I’m afraid I colored my perception of the Zelda series by starting with Breath of the Wild. I don’t find the “traditional” Zelda formula to be all that appealing; going through dungeons in a fixed order with a super basic adventure story that I don’t feel is “epic” enough to warrant copious amounts of cutscenes and dialogue.

I can appreciate certain characters in a vacuum (Midna is awesome), but I think I gravitate more towards “gameplay driven” experiences with Zelda because it has such a basic narrative. This would explain why my very next Zelda game was A Link Between Worlds on 3DS, which I absolutely adored and didn’t feel like my time was wasted. And that’s because it gave me a feeling of freedom similar to that of Breath of the Wild, and I may just like it slightly more.

So I think I’ve gotten my point across as to what I look for in Zelda. Maybe I’m looking at the series with the wrong expectations, and I don’t doubt that the previous traditional entries have their merits. But I guess when I want an epic adventure, I want something bigger in scope. Can anyone empathize with me here? Or am I the weird one?",I find Xenoblade more appealing to me than Zelda.

"I'm not ignoring how comical these bugs/framerates are, they are funny at most, but I truly don't give a damn about any of it because I'm having so much fun. I stopped playing on Sun/Moon because I got bored and didn't like the removal of gyms. 

I had no expectations of anything from this game, as I didn't read up on it or spoil anything and I am having a fucking blast. Is it archaic looking, sure, but I am still having fun. Non of it is game breaking. What really kicks it into gear for me is being able to explore with friends. This is something I've been wanting for far too long and I really hope this is a feature that will stay in future games. 

I'm not trying to say anyone is wrong for being upset by making this post, but I am making this for those who don't care about those or who are also really enjoying it so far. My only advice to those who hate it, is to get a refund and go back to playing another Pokemon game that you love.

"With the clear technical limitations the Switch has been experiencing since the beginning and the problem becoming more and more apparent over the years with Scarlet and Violet reigniting the call for a more powerful switch, what way do you think Nintendo should go about it?

Considering how much the Switch is BEHIND other consoles at this point a HUGE leap needs to be taken to have it be able to somewhat compete with new systems.

Here's a couple of ways I've thought of that they can help mitigate this huge gap in power but feel free to leave your thoughts or shoot other ideas!

・The sacrifice route.

Because of the huge gap in power and how difficult and expensive it would be to make a powerful dual system, Nintendo decides to make another model for the Switch that's the opposite of the Lite.

This model is dock only but has roughly the same power as an Xbox One for like 350-400$

This makes developing games for the Switch WAAAYYY easier but likely leads to a lot of exclusive releases.

・The ""New"" 3DS route.

Make a slightly more powerful Switch model that's still a dual system and sell with the others.

・The full update route.

Nintendo releases a decently more powerful Switch that replaces all the original and oled models and retires them.

It's the same price as the original just a decent bit more powerful but nothing special.


Overall these are the main ways I can think of Nintendo doing for a more powerful Switch.

Personally I'm heavily leaning towards a way more powerful but docked only model.

That way all the restrictions on battery life come off and we can see games alot better optimized.

While the models that are portable can be weaker, but this feels like fair compromise to me tbh. 

Trading power for portability but giving people the option for seems like a good idea to me.

Imagine New Switch games with all that power

"I am not someone who usually cares about graphics and performance, but seeing how beautiful SWSH was, this feels as a downgrade, that I paid (expensive in my country) for.

I stil think SWSH was the greatest and most beautiful Pokémon game ever created. I just got to the bigger city of SV and I am UTTERLY disappointed with clear signs that the game was rushed such as npcs you cannot talk, stores that have no interior, buildings you cannot enter, camera glitches, slow loading on stores and boxes, very bad antialiasing and so on, this is totally making me lose the focus in the game and story.

The top grossing franchise in the world, the record pre-ordered game for Pokémon, this is all we get? You think it will ever get improved?

You cannot say it's Switch's fault when you can play Skyrim, No Man's Sky and The Witcher really.

Extremely disappointed. First time ever I could purchase on release, sadly. The game LOOKS and FEELS worse than X & Y on 3DS.

"Feeling old yet? Yes today is indeed the 20th anniversary of both Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime, two entries in the Metroid franchise that are highly regarded in the eyes of critics and fans. After 8 years of silence following the release of Super Metroid, we finally got a return in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance and GameCube. Fusion brought the 2D series back into the spotlight and narratively continued off from Super, and Prime brought the franchise into 3D for the very first time and became one of *the* reasons to own a GameCube.

[Metroid Fusion](https://youtu.be/ORJnXhI1dBM) was the brainchild of series co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto, who wanted to implement more story elements into the Metroid series. And he accomplished this through specially curated setpieces and a more terrifying atmosphere thanks to a new threat: the SA-X. Metroid Prime on the other hand has a more complicated history regarding developer Retro Studios, so I recommend checking out [this video](https://youtu.be/tuc8X9qKePo) for more details.

Fusion has been re-released exactly twice: once on the Wii U Virtual Console and once as part of the 10 GBA games included with the 3DS Ambassador Program. Prime has seen a few more re-releases: once in Japan as part of the New Play Control line, again along with its two sequels as part of the Metroid Prime Trilogy compilation, and finally the Trilogy version as part of the Wii U Virtual Console. So if you own a Wii U and are interested at all in checking out the series, these are worth picking up!",Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime are now 20 years old! What do you think about these massively acclaimed entries in the longrunning series?,yxqtco
Before 2014 the longest period Retro went without releasing a game was 4 years. So other than the remaster of Tropical Freeze there was nothing between the original release of that game and 2019 when Nintendo moved Metroid Prime 4 over to them from Bandai. Sooooooo…..what exactly were they doing in that time?,I would love to know what Retro Studios was doing between the release of Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze and 2019,yyujjs

"The Wario ware games are very cool and inventive, but not really my thing.  More power to you if you love them. But it makes me really sad how nintendo has seemingly put all of their wario energy towards those games and those games alone. The Wario Land series are definitely my favorite platformers after the Mario games. They are so inventive, with a lot of variation in how wario gains new temporary abilities from enemies who injure wario or cause him to gain weight or any number of of other things. They always had great character design and animation, and were always just very fun and funny games with a kind of odd unique tone from other nintendo fare.

"This is going to be a long post, it's mostly me working through my thoughts about the game.  TLDR, look at the title, but for people who like the game I understand.  It's very well executed, is a credit to the series, and is an honest to goodness Metroid game, which I will definitely support.  I just had zero fun playing this game, and I wanted to put out a post for other people like me, who might be on the fence.

My only real experience with Metroid games are the Prime games and Metroid Fusion.  I loved the Prime Games, hated Fusion, because it felt like I was just face tanking the whole game.  What I liked about the Prime games was the exploration of the fallen civilization, the puzzles, and the intense and fun combat.  So I want to look at Dread through those lenses.  

Combat:

Let's start with combat, because that's probably the defining aspect of this game.  Combat by the end of the game just means boss fights, there are other enemies but upgrades actually make them negligible.  So since you can skip everything else by the end, how are the boss fights?

Hard.

Now there's nothing wrong with hard.  I beat all the Dark Souls games, I beat Sekiro, I go back and replay them, they're fun.  And Dread bosses are hard in kinda the same way and are definitely fair, they're just a massive drag.  The problem is that the bosses do a TON of damage, and you do very little damage in return (which like, no duh that's why it's hard) but let me contrast it with a few things to give you a sense of what's going on.

These bosses are NOT just quick tests of knowledge.  You can't just know the patterns and as soon as you demonstrate that you can move on to the next thing, you deal too little damage.  So that one move that keeps killing you?  You can't just dodge it once, you have to dodge it like 4-5 times and then you move on to the next stage.

It's also not a battle of attrition.  You take too much damage to ever trade hits, some bosses seem to take multiple energy tanks off per hit, so you want to only get hit 4 or 5 times to get through, otherwise you die.

It all adds up to feeling like I'm playing a bullet hell platformer, which is less than ideal, and I never got a sense of relief or accomplishment beating any of these bosses.  Just ""Done with that, good riddance""

Also there are basically Quick Time Events in the boss fights, and some bosses can only be beaten after passing them.  And that sucks.

ALSO also there are no health bars on enemies, nor is damage displayed some other way, so you have no idea whether that last attempt was close or horrendously far from getting it.

Exploration

The loop of get an upgrade, unlock more routes, go back and explore is the heart and soul of Metroidvania games, and so this part is the most important to me.  I talk about it second because the difficult combat gives you the context you need to understand me when I say the exploration in this game is nearly pointless.

First, combat is so hard that the upgrades are almost negligible.  There are not enough energy tanks in the game to make you not feel squishy, and the missile tanks add just 2 missiles.  Like, grab what you see, but figuring out that puzzle from that one room way back there will not help you more than just beating your head against whatever you're stuck on five more times.  Like it sucks to say it, but there was only one boss that I barely beat, all the rest I was usually at half health when I beat them.

Second, this game has a kind of nasty habit of forcing you forward.  I basically gave up on exploring halfway through the game until right at the end, because every time I tried to get off the beaten path I found that one door I opened triggered an explosion or I slipped down a slope and oh look there's another boss.  Like, I know us true gamers are all against hints of where to go, but those hints are really nice for knowing what is ACTUALLY a side path and what is not.

There are many stealth sections in the game and those areas are better marked, but how to get through them is not.  The earlier ones of those are actually better, in that there are bigger rooms with more platforms, so you can actually be clever and good at using your movement tools to evade.  The later ones are almost linear.  Harder?  Yes, but not for a good reason.

Third, and this goes along with the second point, this game is actually really linear.  The line the developer sends you on loops and twists, but it's still mostly a line.  Like, I would love to see speedruns of this, but it takes something like five upgrades to even be able to explore AT ALL and I only felt like I got one good exploration session in with significant backtracking.  That was with three bosses left.

Puzzles

And then we get to the puzzles, which suffer from the same pointlessness as the exploration.  Some of them just take more time than you get in terms of payoff.  Keep in mind, many of these puzzles only give you 2 missiles.

The worst part is that most of them don't even feel rewarding.  Like you don't feel clever for finding them, or really for solving them.  You can't really affect things off screen, so almost all the puzzles are contained within a few body lengths, so it's usually just a matter of ""can I blow up this block?"" If you can, you solve it, if not you don't.

There are some hard puzzles, but they mostly involve really good timing.  Like, ""I know exactly what to do and it still took 25 times"" timing.  Which, is just not fun.  Especially when the payoff is often just not worth it.

Overall:

It sucks writing this, I wanted to like this game, and it is kind of incredible that every attack can be dodged, and yet it is still difficult and ramps up in difficulty.  It's a good game and I'm currently at the last boss, but I don't think I'm even going to beat him just because it will bring me no joy, nor a sense of accomplishment.  If it does for you, that's great!  If you want a lineup of a few dozen good looking boss fights in the Metroid universe that are mostly unique and challenging but still fair this game has that!  I just wanted something else I guess.","Metroid Dread is a fantastic game, that's no fun to play",qobp59

I used to write for the official Nintendo Magazine in Brazil, that was called “Nintendo World”. For more than 15 years, the magazine was published down here as the official paper publication for Nintendo. It was Brazilans’s Nintendo Power - for more than a decade this publication also had articles from the US counterpart as well. 

For some reason I’m not familiar with, the official US content stopped to be shared to Brazil and the local team needed to come up with 100% original content for the mag. It was a big challenge since around that time, circa 2009, the magazine sales weren’t so big and the team very small - around 5 editors in the company + 5 or 6 freelancers. 

On November 2009, we were editing the January issue that would be a vacations special. No big announcements, no Nintendo Power content, all the big holiday games were already featured in the latest issues and we also use to edit the January issue almost 2 month in advance due the editorial team vacations. 

The scarcity of content lead our editor to suggest something wild: what if we ask a artist to create a image with Mario, Peach and the gang in the beach? You know, January in Brazil is summer. And Brazil is HOT in the summer. 

Nobody thought that it would be approved - since the magazine still carried the Nintendo official seal and had relationship with the Japanese company after all. 

But somehow the crazy cover art hit the streets. 

It was all over the place. Unofficial art in the cover of the official Nintendo Magazine in Brazil. Peach in Bikini, Fire flower sunscreen, Bowser surfing... god, looking back I still don’t know how we were able to print this. 

Hope you enjoyed this piece of Brazilian magazine history. Use masks!",The story of the unofficial Mario vacation cover art in a official Nintendo Magazine,irnt55
"Hey everyone!

Since my post about Octopath Traveler vs Bravely Default sparked a very friendly discussion, I'd figure I'd start a new one! Which game do you LIKE better: Xenoblade 1 or Xenoblade 2? I absolutely love the first game as it is my favorite game of all time and made me completely turn into a Nintendo fanboy. The story is by far the best RPG story I've ever played and I love every single thing about it. The music is godly, I adored the voice acting, the battle system is simple yet fun (although I'm a huge WoW player so I might be biased), the characters were lovable, and I could go on forever. I really enjoyed Xenoblade 2 and the ending blew my mind, I thought Malos was an amazing villain, as the supporting cast was fantastic. The battle system was incredibly in depth but a little too indepth IMO. The game's way of making Blades random felt like I was playing a mobile game, the oversexualization of women was shameless and annoying, the battle banter was headache inducing, and field skills are probably my least favorite mechanic in any RPG I've played. I also feel like the story and music, while still amazing, wasn't as good as the first game's.

"With the ability to use SD cards to increase storage, it would be amazing if we are able to add our own videos to the cards and watch them through a basic video player on the Switch.

I’m about to travel and it would be so convenient if I could have both my movies and games on the Switch and not have to bring a laptop also just to watch movies.

It’s kind of crazy it’s been 1.5 years and we still only have hulu as the only video option, if you aren’t gonna give us Netflix etc. at least a basic VLC like player would do wonders.

Anyways sorry for my rant, hope people agree",The Switch should seriously have at least a basic video player,8y5u2r
"Is it because the company is/was being mostly operated by game designers like Iwata and Myamoto? I've always admired the fact that Nintendo games always never have bugs post launch, they always run at 60 fps, and are always packed full of content.

I know a lot of the developers would rush games to get them out during the holiday hunt and fix everything post launch, and it's probably mostly because of profit. 

Why does Nintendo think different?",Why are Nintendo games always so much more polished than other game developers?,3md1es
"I fianlly picked up 999 and am loving it, already finished my second playthrough!

I can't believe that I didn't get this game until now, which got me wondering what other games I've been missing out on. I've had a DSi since it came out, but I didn't play many games on it (I skipped the DS because I was very into the Gameboy). I have played the Ace Attorney series, Ghost Trick, the Zelda series, and Professor Layton (and enjoyed all of them, especially the Shu Takumi games).

Can anyone help me out and suggest some awesome NDS games that I might enjoy or any games that are considered a must-play for the system?",What are some must-have DS games?,2zjds9
