I want to fix it so that I can play old games like splatoon, wind waker, old wii games and other stuff like that
Or if there's no way for me to get the chance to play older games, I'd like to at least sell it and get something out of it (not exactly trying to sell it to anyone through this post)

11atfrq,"What do folks here think of Mario Strikers Battle League, almost 1 year after its initial reveal?","With another year to possibly grace us with a new Mario sports game, I thought it’d be appropriate to reflect on [the last one](https://youtu.be/SW2mgcAxdWs). And how that one quickly become forgotten amongst the Nintendo community. It had been 15 years since the last Mario Strikers game, and to give reference: Rosalina didn’t exist when the last Strikers came out. So needless to say, expectations from fans were high. I personally didn’t grow up playing Mario sports, but I hear endless praise for Charged back on the Wii.

But as we got closer to launch, Nintendo said those five little words that sent off warning sirens in my head: “free updates will be added.” This was immediately concerning. Now I don’t dislike free content updates on principle; after all New Pokemon Snap got one and that was pretty fun. The problem comes when we look back at the previous Mario sports games on Switch. Mario Tennis Aces had some fun competitive gameplay to stave off the monotony, but Mario Golf Super Rush I actually really hated. I was sincerely hoping Battle League wouldn’t fall into the same pit as those two.

But… it seemed like I was right to be worried. Battle League launched in June of 2022 and I bought it day 1 for full price. And I seriously wish I didn’t. There was hardly any single player content to keep me engaged, the stadiums all felt the same, the online was a crapshoot especially if I wanted to play with friends, and the overly precise timing and mechanics did not translate well into Nintendo’s online service. I bounced off hard, and by the time Daisy was added Xenoblade 3 was coming out and my attention was squarely on that. Not worth $60.

So that’s my little schpeel on Mario Strikers Battle League, one of the more underwhelming first party games I’ve played on Switch. But what did you think? Did you get more out of it more than I did?",Asad_Farooqui,1,17,97,331,1867,0,0

in my opinion, they need to keep the name mario kart have it be a majority of mario characters. and then they could add some of nintendo’s all-stars into the roster. Link, Zelda, Pikachu, Kirby, Samus, Captain Falcon, Fox, Inkling, Villager, Ness. and that’s it. i don’t think we need Sonic or Pac-Man or Mega Man because this is still mario kart. not smash. just 10 of nintendo’s most iconic characters and then have rest be entirely the mario cast.",Ok-Connection4791,1,10,57,151,820,0,0

I know R.O.B. was used for Stack-Up and Gyromite on the NES, but he was more of an accompanying toy and less of an actual character. 

This has led me to wonder what an all-new current-gen video game might be like featuring R.O.B. as the main playable character.

I was planning on selling my faulty ones and just keeping the new set I bought. However, now that I learned my faulty set are the set that came with the console, I'm wondering if I would be better off simply swapping the shells and then selling the faulty ones with the brand new shells? 

Meaning, I keep the new Joycons with my old Green Left set of shells, while my old Joycons will be sold with the new Pink Left set of shells.

Is this worthwhile? Or is there no value in the Green Left set? I ask because I kinda wanted to have a brand new set, since the old Green Left shells aren't in perfect condition (there are very small scratch marks on the green one). But if the Green Left set is more valuable despite these flaws, I'd rather keep those.

Is there any value in the Green Left set? Or should I just sell it the way it is and keep the Pink Left set?",sonicrings4,1,8,38,215,1109,0,0

When you think of 3D Mario games this one probably comes to mind first. While it may have some glitches (though really not many) and look simple compared to the two predecessors, it's remembered for one thing it offers most (arguably of any game ever, aside from Minecraft): freedom. There's no objective way to beat the game like there is for most games. You have the freedom to beat it however you want. There's almost no power ups or gimmicks, so you have an immense amount of freedom for how you can move around. And this freedom is what has carried this game to have the legacy it earned. Almost everything about this game has made a community of its own: The A button challenge, making remixes of other songs using the game's simple soundfont, speedrunning (like 5 different subcommunities), the TAS community, people like SMG4, etc. Mario 64 might be simple and lacking in some ways, this game is the greatest because of it's influence and the freedom it offers.

Sunshine: My FAVORITE 3D Mario game. And it's probably your favorite too. Or your least favorite. It's very divisive. This game like 64 isn't the most well polished and leaves some things to be desired. Speedrunners initially looked down on the game because of the slow nature of the game because of the cutscenes. Not to mention the RNG. But overlooking it's problems, the game has such a nice atmosphere to it that makes it so fun to play. Don't you wish you could go to Isle Delfino and hang with the Piantas? As a kid I loved Sirena Beach's 3rd Shine Sprite with Yoshi. I wished I could go into the game and sleep at the hotel after a long days worth of collecting shine sprites. Or chilling out at Gelato Beach. I even wrote a route on how to get all the shine sprites in the game when I was 10 or so. While the path to beating the game is very direct, I love the process of collecting all the delfino plaza shines after you beat Bowser. The music isn't the most triumphant and beautiful, but you can't tell me Sky and Sea and Pinna Park's theme aren't bangers. Also the ideas are great: Who wouldn't want to Pop Bowser Jr. balloons whlie riding around in a Roller Coaster? How about Riding on a Blooper Squid? The list goes on. Either you love it or you hate it, this was one of the riskiest Mario games, and it's my favorite as a result.

Galaxy: The BEST 3D Mario game (from 3D All Stars at least). This game is great. Amazing even. I didn't grow up with it because my Wii had problems as a kid, so I was happy to find out it was coming to the Switch. I wasn't the biggest fan at first, I was concerned there wasn't going to be many stars per level among other small issues, but I came to love this game in the years since I played it. I had a lot of fond memories trying to get the purple coins, the anticipation of going to the hub with Gusty Garden Galaxy, Freezeflame Galaxy and the desert galaxy, trying to catch those damn snow bunnies, etc. Much effort was put into this game to make it feel special to play. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and is one of the best of all video games. I personally love Hell's Prominence. The controls are smooth and freeing (not as much as 64 and a bit frustrating sometimes but still). The ideas are ambitious and fun to play around in. The game looks amazing visually too. You can really tell how much they cared about making the game great. It's not my personal favorite, but you can't deny that Galaxy is the best game because of how polished and well rounded it is. You could argue Odyssey is better, but I didn't really get as much out of it (I'm normally a completionist when it comes to collectathons, but not when theres like 800+ things to collect). I also like SMG2 a lot (first played it recently), but it lacks the charm of the original and some stars are waaay harder than the stars of Galaxy 1.

11a9omy,Hot Take: Miis look bad in HD,"I adore mii characters, I love their design and they hold a special place in my heart. However, I think I know why people don’t like the miis in nintendo switch sports and stuff.

We’re all used to the blocky and SD feel of the Wii, since it was quite an underpowered console. Then on the 3DS, that wasn’t near SD either, and that console supported miis like no other!

This was the golden age of mii characters.

When the Wii U came along, and nintendo stepped into HD gaming, they still supported miis incredibly well, but no one really knows that besides nintendo gamers since the wii u was such a commercial failure.

When nintendo didn’t take advantage of miis on the switch, besides user interfaces, everyone was understandably a bit upset. Then on nintendo switch sports, the focus was sports mates instead and people didn’t like that either. But the people that liked the sports mates didn’t like the miis, but why?

The miis look very weird in HD, they have such smooth faces and they look too overworked in character design. They don’t look the same as in the wii and 3DS. I love that idea but some people don’t and I understand why.

The solution? I think it’s nearing the time to put miis to rest since the modern era of nintendo is appending right before our eyes.

I love miis with all my heart, but I can’t see nintendo taking advantage of them ever again.

Like, if you had to have 4 of their franchises serve as the mascots for the entire company, which would you pick? Though they are franchises, I ask that we exclude Smash Bros. and Mario Kart from discussion for this post since I’m focusing more on original franchises with their own set of unique characters. 2nd party franchises like Pokémon are okay though. As long as the franchises are owned/partially owned by Nintendo, they count. Things to consider: popularity, sales, other forms of media (spin-offs, apps, merchandise, TV shows, etc.), how often new games come out, and how long the franchise has been relevant.

In my opinion, Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Pokémon are 100% on this list.

As for the 4th one, this could be tricky. It’s really up to opinion, but I’ve got to give it to Kirby. This franchise has always had a consistent amount of attention given to it since it was first created. The sales for this franchise aren’t game-changing, but the games always have a decent amount of sales and new games come out at a frequent pace. Kirby also had its own TV show adaptation that was actually pretty mainstream and was rivaled only by Pokémon for Nintendo animes. Aside from all that, characters like Kirby, Meta Knight and King Dedede are just very iconic in general.

I considered Donkey Kong, Metroid, Animal Crossing, and Splatoon, but Kirby ultimately beat them for me. I excluded Donkey Kong and Metroid because the frequencies at which new games come out for these franchises aren’t very high. Animal Crossing and Splatoon were close, because the average sales per game are definitely higher than Kirby’s. However, I gave it to Kirby because it gets content more frequently and because it has more brand recognition. It’s also been out longer.

 * ***Helmet*** was released in 1981 for the Game & Watch Gold in Japan. In this action game, developed by *Nintendo R&D1*, the construction workers are trying to get from the building to the shed, but tools are raining down from above. Move each construction worked from the building on the left to the shed on the right without being hit by the falling tools. The shed door closes sometimes, so you have to move back and forth. The longer each worker spends outside, the more tools fall.

   
   
 * ***Crab Grab*** was released in 1984 for the Game & Watch Super Color in Japan. In this action game, developed by *Nintendo R&D1*, Mr. Grab must clear the Demon Crabs from the top row of the screen, but when he pushes them off of the top of the screen, they reappear at the bottom and stack. There are four columns of Demon Crabs. Move Mr. Grab and push the Demon Crabs off the top of the screen.When you do, they reappear on the bottom and may attack, so move out of their way.

   
   
 * ***Family BASIC V3*** was released in 1985 for the Family Computer in Japan. This programming utility, developed by *Hudson Soft* with *Nintendo* and *Sharp*, is an updated version of *Family BASIC*, featuring more built-in games and a simplified user-interface. *Family BASIC* allows the user to program simple game in the customised BASIC language NS-HUBASIC (developed by *Nintendo*, *Sharp* and *Hudson Soft*).

   
   
 * The ***Family Computer Disk System*** was released in 1986 in Japan. A peripheral for *Nintendo*'s *Family Computer* home video game console. It uses proprietary floppy disks called ""Disk Cards"" for cheaper data storage and it adds a new high-fidelity sound channel for supporting *FDS* games. Its name is sometimes shortened as ***Famicom Disk System*** or simply ***Disk System***, and abbreviated as ***FCDS***, ***FDS***, or ***FCD***. The *Famicom Disk System* briefly served as an enabling technology for the creation of a new wave of home console video games and a new type of video game experience, mostly due to tripling the size of cheap game storage compared to affordable cartridge ROMs, and by storing gamers' progress within their vast new adventures. These games include the open world design and enduring series launches of *The Legend of Zelda* (1986) and *Metroid* (1986), with its launch game *Zelda* considered to be one of the greatest games of all time due mostly to its expansiveness.

   
   
 * ***The Legend of Zelda*** was released in 1986 for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan. In this action/adventure game, developed by *Nintendo*, reunite the Triforce and send Ganon packing! Ganon, the King of Evil, has broken free of the Dark World and has captured Hyrule's beloved Princess Zelda.

In this rail shooter/shoot 'em up game, developed by *Argonaut* with *Nintendo EAD*, the insane scientist Andross was exiled on the planet Venom many years ago, but he continued his experiments and raised an army. Now his war machine is rolling across the Lylat system. General Pepper of the Cornerian army contacts the mercenary team Star Fox to slip through Andross' defences and lead an assault on the planet Venom.

   
   
 * ***Itoi Seigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1*** was released in 1997 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this fishing game, developed by *HAL Laboratory*, walk around a lake, jump in a boat and head out onto the waters to begin fishing. Choose your rod, bait, and more as you hunt for the biggest fish in the lake. Bagging a fish will earn you money, and the more money you have, the more fishing components you can collect, and the bigger and rarer the fish you can catch.

   
   
 * The ***Game Boy Camera*** was released in 1998 for the Game Boy in Japan. This video game accessory, developed by *Nintendo R&D1* with  *Jupiter*, is a camera for the Game Boy that takes four colour pictures.

The *Game Boy Camera* software contains a huge range of camera settings and image editing options.

   
   
 * ***Trade & Battle: Card Hero*** was released in 2000 for the Game Boy Color in Japan. In this role-playing game, developed by *Nintendo R&D1* with *Intelligent Systems*, you play as Hiro, a boy who wants to master the Card Hero trading card game. A gang has been causing trouble in the area, and Hiro will have to face them if he wants to become the champion. Each player has a Master card, and the objective is to defeat this card. Players also hold Monster cards and stones that allow cards to be played.

   
   
 * ***Domo-Kun no Fushigi Terebi*** was released in 2001 for the Game Boy Advance in Japan. In this variety game, developed by *Suzak*, Domo and his friends were watching TV in Usaji's house, when a meteor strikes, sucking Domo into the TV set. If he wants to escape, then he must complete a week's worth of minigames, each one a different TV show. Domo is the the title character of a series of advertisements for the NHK-TYO TV station in Japan. The game was developed by *Suzac*, a developer owned by the TV station.

   
   
 * ***Cubivore: Survival of the Fittest*** was released in 2001 for the Nintendo GameCube in Japan. In this action-adventure game, developed by *Saru Brunei* with *Intelligent Systems*, in a land populated by animals made of cubes, the Killer Cubivore sits at the top of the food chain, absorbing the ""Wilderness"", the essence of the land. You have to climb to the top of the food chain and overthrow the Killer Cubivore, restoring the Wilderness to the world. Your Cubivore mutates based on its colour, intensity and limbs.

   
   
 * ***Play-Yan*** was released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance in Japan. A media player that can read MP3 music files and MP4 video files from an SD Card using flash memory. Due to its power requirements, it was not compatible with the original model Game Boy Advance. It was also possible to download a number of minigames from Nintendo's website which could be added to an SD Card and played on the *Play-Yan*. The original model was discontinued after just 7 months, and a second model was released 2 days after the discontinuation.

117svwx,"Assuming that Nintendo is able to put on any game they want, what games would you like to see on the NSO systems?","While the NES and SNES have most of the big hitters (though not everything I'd want), the four newer consoles (GB, GBA, Genesis, and N64) are still a bit newer and have a lot of potential for good games to add on. What games in particular would you like to see on them?

Speaking just for myself:

**NES:** There isn't a lot on the NES service that's missing imo? I mean, sure, you could never go wrong with the Mega Mans and Castlevanias of the age, but I think the biggest missing one would be Duck Hunt. Literally just make it Wii style and use the Joycons' gyro controls, easy enough. 

**SNES:** The SNES also has a lot of its heavy hitters already present. Again, Mega Man X's, Castlevanias, etc, never hurts. My biggest issue is the lack of RPGs. Most of them are third party so I get it, but... the SNES is home to some of the best. Super Mario RPG and Chrono Trigger are my biggest wishlist items. Super Street Fighter II and Super Bomberman are also up there.

**Genesis:** I mean, come on. Sonic. Obviously this is a bit of a tough call to make given Sonic Origins existing and the other legal issues, but I would *love* to see Sonic 3 and Knuckles on there. Maybe Michael Jackson's Moonwalker? Again, also Super Street Fighter II. Ironically, besides the lack of Sonic, the Genesis set is a lot more diverse than some of Nintendo's offerings here. Sega does, I guess.

**N64:** The N64... really didn't have that many big titles to call its own, did it? Even still, there's some big ones missing. Smash 64 being missing is an obvious one, but there's also stuff like Banjo Tooie and hopefully the rest of Rare's catalogue, Mario Party 3, the Pokemon Stadium games... if I could make a wish though, I'd go for the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games.

**GB:** Now, I've never really been that big on the GB's library, to be honest, but there's still some good potential here. The rest of the Wario Land games spring to mind first, but there's also DK '94, Mario's Picross (bias lol), the Kirby games... oh, and that one monster game with the balls. Don't remember what it's called. Something about February 27th?

**GBA:** This is where a lot of my knowledge comes in. It's too early to say what Nintendo's plans are for the GBA offerings, but I've got quite a few I'd like to see. Metroid Zero Mission, the Pokemon games, Zelda Four Swords, the rest of the Super Mario Advance games, Wario Land 4, Kirby Nightmare In Dreamland, WarioWare Twisted (please), Mario vs. Donkey Kong, maybe even Mother 3... lots to ask for here, and I really really hope Nintendo delivers.

Given the news of Microsoft's new contract with Nintendo and CoD, it got me thinking.  Nintendo will need a new powerful hardware to run the latest AAA games.

Nintendo and Apple have been working together for several years now, first with getting Super Mario Run on the App Store.  The mobile company that helped Nintendo get Mario on the iPhone; DeNa, is now forming a partnership with Nintendo under a new company, Nintendo Systems Co., Ltd which opens in April 2023

https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/11/08/nintendo-teaming-up-to-make-more-games-for-iphone/amp/


The similarities in the business models are well documented;

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-01-24/nintendo-switch-longevity-shows-parallels-with-apple

Apple has also been rumored to be making a Switch competitor, but they're well aware of how hard it is to break into the 3 team console race without established 1st party games.

https://www.imore.com/heres-why-apple-wont-release-nintendo-switch-style-hybrid-console

What if, and it's a massive if, the two companies combine forces to get a high end console onto the market that would allow Nintendo to reach the major AAA games market, and Apple to develop their first piece of dedicated gaming hardware since the Pippin

Nintendo has already shown a willingness to extend their software IPs outside of their homegrown hardware division.  This move would allow Nintendo to outsource high end hardware development, while still maintaining a lead on the mobile games market, sort of how they managed with the DS.  The marketing of a mutual platform would be equally beneficial

1176m11,An Ode to Wario Land 4,"I’m an aging Nintendo fan who has paid for my fair share of nostalgia remasters or re-releases and been disappointed by many. But when they announced the Gameboy collections I started to get really excited. I scanned the list of games and there it was: Wario Land 3, a title that surely heralds the subsequent masterpiece: Wario Land 4, the first video game I ever beat.

As a young child in the late 90s, video games were changing fast but many of them were not easy. I only ever played them at my friend Jacob’s house who had an N64. Even in coop I don’t think I ever won, but I was too young to know or care. By my next birthday I was begging for a console of my own and I got it: the chunky but ergonomic Gameboy advance. The first game I had was The Lion King game and it was too damn hard. The precision platforming skills that some of these games required was more than my kid brain could accomplish; I don’t know if I ever beat the first few levels. Then, that same year GBA came out, the 5th game with the greedy and possibly evil protagonist was released: Wario Land 4. 

Wario Land 4 drops any prior storyline and follows Wario into a strange Ziggurat/pyramid structure deep in a jungle. There are four themed sections of the pyramid with sequential levels that each lead to a boss. However the 4 sections can be tackled non-linearly. In each level, you attempt to reach the end where you grab a key bird, flip a switch, and trigger a countdown prompting you to get back to the beginning of the level as soon as possible. What’s really interesting about this is that the levels often change dramatically as the time ticks down, and you must contend with new obstacles, like a ghost who steals the key, or a route which turned to lava. 

The boss battles in this game really left such a lasting mark in my brain. There’s a Little Shop of Horrors plant boss, a crazy bird stuck in a cuckoo clock, a big inflatable teddy bear, and a weird bat/cat thing. Then of course the incredible last Diva boss that tested my child-coordination skills like no other. When I first took down the final boss in this game it was my first victory ever in a video game. And I loved the narrative I was rewarded with at the end of the game. There’s a time limit to the final boss, and if you are slow, Wario gets less treasure and the rescued princess at the end actually looks hilariously different (in order of fastest completion to slowest: “Sexy” princess, Cute princess, Wario mustachioed princess, child princess). As a kid this was all the motivation I needed. I played it again. And again. I essentially committed it to memory. Wario Land 4, the first game I ever beat 20 times. 

WL4 is so rich with color and zaniness matched with incredible level design that still stands up to modern 2D platformers. Wario’s sense of momentum and transformations fit so well to the themes and design of these awesome levels. On top of that, the score is as rich as the environments it is attached to. Even now I can remember the bee level, or the pinball level, the lava/ice level, or the magic carpet level. This Wario game has some really strange ideas, some of which have made their way into later Mario platformers but some have only existed in the beautiful, weird, cult classic. The game has personality and replayability which stands up to the test of time in a way that few games from that era have. The inventive style did not return in the last Wario land game which didn’t come until the Wii and was focused more on Wiimote motion control than platforming. Luckily Wario continued on as a protagonist in the mini game style games, which themselves have an arc, but that’s for another day…

I can only hope that WL4 makes the next round of games in the GB releases. I’ve always loved the side of Mario universe that was a little dark or weird or backwards and it comes from my love of Wario and the uniqueness that comes from (some of) his games. To anyone who has never played WL4, oh I envy you!  Wario Land 4, the first game I ever *loved*.",ThenCopy3562,1,6,22,748,4037,0,0

116r8kj,Here is what you need in order to transfer your Pokemon out of 3DS (quick guide),"The main thing you’ll need is two applications from the 3DS eShop: 1) Pokemon Bank and 2) Poke Transporter. Both are free to download, but one requires a subscription fee to take advantage of its features.

First before you do anything, make sure you own at least one of the Bank-compatible 3DS games, those being the Gen 6 titles and the Alola games. Next make sure you own at least one of the Transporter-compatible games, those being the Gen 5 games on DS and the Virtual Console versions of Gen 1 and 2.

You can download Pokemon Bank for free directly from the 3DS eShop, but you can’t do that for Poke Transporter. After downloading Bank, put the 3DS game in the cartridge slot (not necessary for digital owners) and open up the app. You will be prompted to pay the $5 monthly subscription fee to access Bank’s features, so make sure you transferred enough funds to your 3DS either through your Switch or your MyNintendo account via an internet browser. Please make sure it’s the same account across both platforms too.

Once you pay the fee, you can then use the link provided to download Poke Transporter. It’s hosted from the 3DS eShop and it’s a free download that fortunately does not require a separate subscription fee. Make sure you also have one of the Transporter-compatible games mentioned earlier, either physically in the cartridge slot (for Gen 5) or digitally on your system (for Virtual Console). And now that you have both 3DS apps, you can transfer all your Pokemon from them to Home.

The Bank app will be going free by the end of March, so you won’t have to keep paying the monthly fee to use its services. But if you haven’t downloaded these two apps before that date then you’re screwed, so you also can’t just wait for Bank to go free if you want to use them.",Asad_Farooqui,1,16,80,322,1788,0,0

1177rsj,A lot of signs point towards a new Donkey Kong game coming in the next year,"Other than being an admittedly biased fan of everything Donkey Kong, I think there are a variety of indicators that the iconic ape will finally be getting a new game soon - the first new DK entry in a decade (not counting Tropical Freeze on Switch which was just a port of the 2014 Wii U game).

Let me explain! Other than it having been a ridiculous amount of years passed without a game in one of Nintendo's most iconic IPs, **certain rumours and multimedia activities have a newfound focus on Donkey Kong**, which is unusual given how the franchise otherwise has been relegated to somewhat of a supporting series to Super Mario.

**Reasons why:**

1. The large focus on Donkey Kong (and friends) in the upcoming **Super Mario Bros. Movie** (2023)
2. The (confirmed) **new Donkey Kong area** coming as an expansion to the Super Nintendo World theme parks (2024 in Japan and 2025 in Hollywood)
3. The rumored **Donkey Kong standalone film** following his inclusion in the Mario movie (2024?)
4. In 2024 it will both be **a decade since DK's last game** and also the Donkey Kong Country ""sub-series"" **30th anniversary**
5. The simple fact that the Donkey Kong series **hasn't gotten yet its own entry on the incredibly successful Switch**, a system that otherwise has proven it can boost the sales monumentally of all Nintendo IPs (Metroid, Animal Crossing, Smash Bros, Legend of Zelda etc.)
6. And finally... The heavily rumored **new Donkey Kong Switch game being developed by Nintendo EDP Tokyo**, the developers of Super Mario Odyssey (2023-24?)

Anyhow I feel that all of this, even discounting the unconfirmed rumours, **indicates a level of momentum and respect given to the Donkey Kong franchise that we haven't seen since the 90s**. This must, in my humble DK fan opinion, lead to a long-awaited majestic return of DK, most likely on the Switch sometime in 2024.",Bleus4,1,16,75,319,1872,0,0

115gdl7,Enemies you (might) feel bad for defeating them.,"This topic came to me recently because I finished another playthrough of Metroid: Zero Mission and am now playing Metroid Samus Returns on 3DS.

The context is that I tend to feel bad about obliterating many of these little critter enemies in Metroid games because I see them more as natural wildlife in their habitat - essentially animals and a lot of them don't even seem predatory! They just react with their self-defence instincts to what they have to see as a very dangerous intruder in their ecosystem: Samus Aran.

Second good example are some of the ""enemies"" in Zelda games, e.g. the crabs in A Link to the Past or the ChuChu's (especially the version in Breath of the Wild).

In Super Mario games I sometimes feel bad for throwing/kicking the Koopa Troopa in its shell in a place where it will continuously bounce back and forth. I imagine how sickening that must feel... Compared to that a good quick fireball shot might be preferable?!

What are enemies that you might feel bad for defeating them? I would love to read some thoughts!

P.S. If you allow me to stray from Nintendo-specific for one last example, because it is so weird... I always felt that the sound a defeated Cacodemon in OG Doom makes (""brrrhhrrb"") sounds horribly sad, so sometimes I don't want to defeat them and let them live.",arnounymus,1,8,48,231,1309,0,0

My theory is that princess peach has been kidnapped by bowser and instead of being saved by mario she escaped by herself. So she kinda had to become this badass to protect herself and her kingdom without someone like mario. While it’s probably from knight amor, peaches axe could be the one you defeat bowser with in the classic games and that’s just how she displays it.

**What is Slamfest '99?**

Slamfest '99 was an official promotional event for the N64's *Super Smash Bros.* that took place in Las Vegas on April 24, 1999. It featured a real-life, staged wrestling match between costumed performers dressed as Mario, Pikachu, Yoshi, and DK, and was broadcasted live on Nintendo's website via RealPlayer. The costumes used were the same as those seen in the well-known [North American commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K783SDTBKmg) for the game.

Despite the live broadcast, and despite it being available to be rewatched in RealPlayer for several months afterward, no video footage of Slamfest '99 is known to survive anywhere on the modern-day internet - it's completely lost. With  little evidence of the event even occurring, it has languished in extreme obscurity for over two decades, even among hardcore Nintendo fans. Since May 2020, a group of fans and archivists from the Lost Media Wiki have been actively searching for the lost broadcast footage (of which I'm a member).

If you're interested in learning more, check out the [Slamfest '99 article on SmashWiki](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Super_Smash_Bros._Slamfest_%2799) for more details on the event, as well as [LSuperSonicQ's video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn5fiiUiV8sa3BNPv7VR2y-RL_VdwTrNa) that chronicle the ongoing search effort.

**Image Details**

These 31 new photographs were provided courtesy of Ed Espinoza, Slamfest '99's producer. They were scanned from his personal collection, and he was gracious enough to offer them to the search team to be shared around. Ed has previously been [interviewed by GameXplain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Coa7gZdAUMM) to talk about his memories of Slamfest '99's production.

These photos reveal new details that had never been seen before in the search, such as the performers' rehearsals, the gameplay stations to preview Smash 64, the surrounding stage area and production equipment, clear images of the referee and announcer, and much more. Very few photographs of the event have surfaced previously, so acquiring a collection this large is substantial news.

Yes! If you have any video footage, images, or information surrounding Slamfest '99, we would be greatly interested to hear from you - please reach out to me (/u/bozo_ssb) here on Reddit, and I'll relay it to the rest of the search team.

Before anyone brings it up, we are already aware of a certain Youtuber who claims to possess footage of the event on an obscure video format. In addition to a history of producing troll content, they have not provided a shred of proof to back up their claims, and we will not be taking them seriously until they do so.

113r613,Would the Wii U have sold better with DS/3DS backwards compatibility?,"If the Wii U had a built-in cartridge reader for DS/3DS games with native backwards compatibility, it may have sold better for the simple reasons that the DS is the #2 best selling console of all time (in hindsight, of course) and the gamepad+TV setup closely mirrors the DS style of play.

For anyone who bought DS titles on the Wii U eShop, the stylus on the gamepad worked remarkably well, mimicking the touchscreen on the bottom screen of the DS. This was also a popular time for 3D TVs, which could theoretically support 3DS titles with its 3D top screen (though not strictly required).

Granted, this may have cannibalized hardware sales of its contemporary handheld system (the 3DS), but the same argument could be made for the Super Game Boy.",X-Boner,1,11,69,131,750,0,0

In this platform game remake of the Nintendo Entertainment System's *Ice Climber*, developed by *Nintendo*, take control of a parka-donned ice climber in this classic 1985 title, battling to climb multiple icy mountains of peril. Avoid or attack enemies who are determined to stop you in your tracks, while bagging the various point-giving collectables and traversing the perilous precipice.

   
   
 * ***Classic NES Series: Super Mario Bros.*** (known in PAL territories as ***NES Classics: Super Mario Bros.***) was released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance in Japan. In this platform game remake of the Nintendo Entertainment System's *Super Mario Bros.*, developed by *Nintendo*, *Donkey Kong* made the monkey famous, and *Super Mario Bros.* did the exact same thing for the handlebar moustached Italian plumber, who came from the brain of one of the most imaginative Japanese game designers ever, Shigeru Miyamoto.

   
   
 * ***Classic NES Series: The Legend of Zelda*** (known in PAL territories as ***NES Classics: The Legend of Zelda***) was released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance in Japan.

 * ***Star Fox: Assault*** was released in 2005 for the Nintendo GameCube in North America. In this rail shooter/third-person shooter, developed by *Namco*, step into the guise of furry flyboy Fox McCloud as he returns to take on his deadliest enemy; wingmen Slippy Toad, Peppy Hare and Falco Lombardi are covering your back, as you take on hordes of intergalactic hostiles on land and in air. Hop into Arwings for aerial skirmishes or Landmasters for ground-based confrontations, or simply run around on foot dispensing laser justice

Compare the amount of content the games have compared to their games on previous systems, and you'll see that there is very little content.

Why do you think that is? Are they trying to rush the games out before they are finished? They aren't even charging for the DLC, so they aren't earning any extra money on it.",WhoAmIEven2,1,10,71,119,685,0,0

110d95i,PSA: Samus breathes/moves camera on her own when standing still. It is NOT stick drift.,"In Metroid Prime Remastered, some of you may have noticed after a second or two of standing still without any input, the camera will start moving on its own ever so slightly and slowly. 

You may start freaking out thinking you have stick drift. This is a feature of the game! 

I booted up the original GC Metroid Prime, and surely enough, after standing still for a moment with no input, Samus starts moving the camera ever so slightly on her own. 

Some of you might say ""Well, that just means you have stick drift on your GC controller! HAH!"". 

In the OG game, if you hold down the right trigger which then allows you to free aim using the left stick (which btw is also available and easily tested using the classic control scheme), this registers as an input, and if you keep on holding the trigger down forever without inputing anything else, the camera will also never move.

So this is a fun and interesting detail, but for newcomers, this may be seem concerning at first. Fear not, this was always part of the OG game.",Neospoon,1,15,87,188,1028,0,0

112f7xo,Why I don't think you should expect another Nintendo console until at least 2027,"So i know Nintendo usually has a console out about every 5 years, give or take. But the Wii U did so poorly, that the Switch has a ton of success due to ports from Wii U games that no one bought because they didn't have the Wii U. the games were consistently great, but no one bought the console, possibly because of the confusion with the Wii U and the Wii being so similar in name, and people not knowing it was a new console. idk what the reason was, but clearly the games were great, but the console caused an issue.

so most of the Switch's success is due to the Wii U's games. which has given them time to spread out the Switch games over more time, because they already have so many games on there from the Wii U. they're milking it for all they can, including the online service.  

and nintendo has not been shy about saying that the games and the experience playing them come before graphic output from the console. so i don't think they'd rush out another console right now for better graphics when most of their games have not been concerned with looking like next gen console graphics for decades now. and especially when the Switch is still selling very well.

i'm sure they're working on the next console like crazy, but i think they realized with the porting of 5 years worth of Wii U games onto the switch AND making switch exclusive games, they realize they really got a good 10 years to get out of this console. maybe even more. 

and that's why i don't think we'll see another console from nintendo until at least ~2027",bradhotdog,1,14,80,288,1539,0,0

At this point, I'm starting to believe the whole ToTK is the last major (aka 10 million sold) game for Switch.

This seems to be paralleling the 3DS as Nintendo was transitioning to the Switch. Pokemon Sun & Moon was arguably the last major Nintendo release for the 3DS in 2016.

110ti5u,"I think we'll probably get the Gen 1/2/3 Pokemon games on Switch, I just don't know if they'll be available separately or as part of Switch Online, what do you guys think?","With Game Boy/Color and Game Boy Advance coming to Switch Online I'm pretty sure we'll see Pokémon games at some point on Switch, the main reasons I think so are: 

&#x200B;

*  With the 3DS eShop ending next month and Gen 1/2 games being unavailable to the public, it would be the perfect time to add these games to the Switch library. 

&#x200B;

* Pokémon Stadium 1/2 still hasn't been released even though it was announced quite early, even GoldenEye 007 which was announced much later has already hit the Switch library, I think the reason they haven't been released yet is because the Pokémon Company is waiting for the Gen 1/2 games to arrive on Switch since the GB Tower is a very important point for Pokémon Stadium games and without this connectivity the games are boring and incomplete, Nintendo has shown that it does not intend to launch its retro games incompletely, this is seen with Super Mario Advance 4 which has the additional levels of the e-Reader accessory, Mario and Luigi: SuperStar Saga ( and Super Mario Advance 4 ) has rumble support and has already been confirmed with dataminer that gyro/motion controls also work on the emulator and that if they wanted even Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble would be playable on the Switch.

&#x200B;

* The Pokémon from the Game Boy games ( Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver and Crystal ) already have their programmed data in Pokémon Home and in the most recent Pokémon games, they even appear with a small Game Boy icon to identify that they are originated from these games.

&#x200B;

With Pokémon Day coming up I think it's just a matter of time before we see the classic Pokémon games on Switch, the question is... are they going to be part of the Switch Online subscription or are they going to be released separately like the NES Fire Emblem ?

110kz93,Splatoon 3 could be so much better,"Let me just preface this by saying I really like Splatoon 2 and I have over 1500 hours in it, but I didn’t even buy Splatoon 3. I borrowed a friends copy to play in this chocolate themed Splatfest but every time I play it, it feels so similar to 2. It seems like this time around they were just focusing on fixing a lot of little things but even just focusing on that, there are so many obvious things that they could have done but didn’t. 

To start, rotations should have been done away with, and they should let you play on more than 2 stages per “rotation.” My solution would be to have the option to picked which ranked mode you want to play available at all times. Once you pick one, then you’d have a voting system like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe online where everybody picks a stage and then the game randomly picks one out of what people picked.

Secondly I want to talk about Salmon Run. Salmon Run is by far my favorite mode in all of Splatoon and I think they actually did the best job at making this feel new compared to everything else in the game, but they could still take it further. Let us have endless Salmon Run that doesn’t end until we miss a quota or everyone dies, with the difficulty raising every round. Let us have a VS mode where two teams of 4 compete to see who can get more golden eggs. I also think the 2 new Salmon Run stages we got are very good but they should have brought back all the old stages from Splatoon 2 (except for Salmonid Smokeyard because that one sucked) Also why can we only play on 1 stage every rotation? It would have been cool to play on a different stage every time.

Lastly in terms of ranked modes, there should have definitely been a new one in the game at launch. My idea would be a mode that focuses on kills and the team that gets the most kills in 5 minutes wins. There isn’t a ranked mode that is just about shooting other people and this would be simple but effective. Also idk where else to put there but idk why ranked modes aren’t part of splatfests. Including them would make splatfests better.

Those are just my thoughts. Splatoon 3 is weird to me because it is a popular game that will be supported for years that came out during the later years of the Switch.  I would have been much more excited for it simply if they waited until the next console. They could have even made it a launch title. Oh well. I’ll be here waiting for Splatoon 4.",Honey__Vanilla,1,7,34,463,2406,0,0
110o0pz,"If a revision ever comes out for Nintendo Switch, I think that 4K is totally unrealistic and at best we will get 1440p (Quad HD or """"2K""""). Let me explain.","Nintendo Switch's success is thanks to 3 things, the concept, the games and the price. And while some games have problems on the switch, it didn't stopped the console from selling well. But it does make the wish of a revision from the general public grow bigger as time passes. But I bet it's not gonna be a crazy upgrade if it ever happens.

Even if games are gonna be upgraded, the price might get a bit out of hand if they're not careful with what they add, and the concept of a hybrid console would suffer as well since the battery life would get shorter if the console is too demanding.

Nintendo knows that, and I think that if they ever release a revision for Nintendo Switch, they would at best add 1080p on portable mode and 1440p on the TV, 6gb of ram at best, 128 gb of storage maximun, a little bit of sacrifice for the battery but nothing too crazy and the price would be $400 which is expensive but also payable, nothing crazy.

10zc0jd,GB and GBA NSO's muted color palette brings back nostalgia to me that no emulator I've used ever has.,"If you've ever played a Game Boy, Game Boy Color or GBA game on an emulator before, you'll have noticed that the color palette is usually very harsh and bright. The black color is 100% black, the white color is 100% white, and everything in between is a very vibrant bright color.

However, the color pallete used for games on NSO looks exactly like how these games looked on the real systems, with muted color palettes that are more true to the real thing. Add on top of it the option to add a pixel grid look and you have something that looks very convincingly like a real Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance. The grid filter you can apply even seems to add a little bit of ghosting to make it look even more convincingly like the real deal.

It's clear that this muted color palette is how these games are **supposed to look**, and it's a shame that a lot of emulator developers don't realize this.

In comparison, NES and SNES games don't actually have a way they're ""supposed to look"", because they were made to be played on a vast variety of TV types, but every game for the Game Boy systems was made with the properties of LCDs of the time in mind.

The Remaster kinda feels like salt in an open wound bc why couldn't they take this engine & make something fresh to the series instead of rehashing something they've already done. I'm mad bc Nintendo kinda ignores franchises that aren't Zelda or Mario even tho there are huge fanbases behind them.

10zy7qz,I like the concept of Nintendo Switch but sometimes I do wonder if it the idea of a hybrid console could've been executed better than it did.,"I recently made a post about a theory I had about how the Nintendo DS could be the next and last console added to the online service, and generally speaking, the responses I got said that the Wii U worked because of the gamepad but the Switch won't be able to emulate the Nintendo DS decently.  
That made me realize something, say what you want about the Wii U game library but the console itself allowed for lots of things and most of them were lost in the transition to the Nintendo Switch, but looking closely, the concept of Switch looks like an evolution of the concept of Wii U, and I though that maybe it's possible to combine both concepts without losing anything, but in order for you readers to understand me, I gotta briefly explain how the Wii U and the Nintendo Switch worked before explaining my concept of an ideal hybrid console, so please, bear with me a little bit.  
It's best to start with the Wii U: it had two fundamental pieces, the console itself which was designed to be stationary (aka a home console) and the Wii U gamepad (which was the main controller to showcase the Wii U functionalities). The games were executed in the console itself and the gamepad connected to the console via an exclusive frequency (which minimized the delay), but while you could leave the room where the console is located and play in other room of your house with the Wii U Gamepad, you couldn't get too far away of the console or else the gamepad wouldn't receive the signal of the console and thus it would be impossible to play from the gamepad. The gamepad can also be used as a second screen and it allowed a decent DS emulation.  
Now let's talk about Nintendo Switch: the two fundamental pieces this time are the console itself which was portable (unlike the wii u) and the dock (which was used to leave the console charging while displaying the image of the game on the TV). Like before, the games are executed in the console itself, but unlike the Wii U gamepad, the dock doesn't use microwave frequency to connect to the console, you put the console into the dock and that's it, I'm serious. Because there's one single screen, apparently it's impossible to emulate the DS in a decent way. Since the Nintendo Switch doesn't depend on the dock, you can take the console anywhere while still being able to use it while also playing the games you want on the go.  
Now that I explained the Wii U and Nintendo Switch, it's time to explain my concept for an ideal hybrid console combining the best of the other 2: the two fundamental pieces are going to be the console which is going to be portable (like the switch) but instead of a dock the second piece is going to be a signal receiver (with an hdmi port to connect it to the TV). As you might have guessed right now, this is very similar to remote play in other platforms, but it has some differences. The games are coming from the console itself but if the console is in near enough of the receiver then the game's image is going to be displayed on the TV as well via an exclusive microwave frequency. With this you could both play the games you want anywhere you like and also simulate a second screen similar to the Wii U with similar functions.  
I can already see comments saying things like ""What's the point of a receiver if this is basically remote play? Why not use any screen I want like the one in my computer?"" Well, since computers normally cannot get microwave frequency (at least not without an adapter) then the only way to execute remote play for those systems would be via WiFi, but if that happens then delay and lag would be unavoidable, so it's far from an ideal way. A receiver and microwave frequency is way better.  
But that's just my concept. What do you think about it? Do you have another concept you like more? Tell me in the replies down below cause I really want to hear your thoughts about this topic.",Low_Confidence2479,1,27,141,716,3898,0,0

10zp8a4,I picked up Metroid Prime Remastered over Hogwarts Legacy and I'm so glad I did.,"Metroid Prime Remastered is such an insanely well-done remake. Runs smoothly, solid control options, looks amazing and perfectly captures the nostalgia of the original.  I was watching some early reviews on Hogwarts Legacy and I'm glad I punted on it for now. Between the complaints about enemy variety, performance and broken AI, and the reviews that seem to gloss over those issues entirely, I just knew that I'd be disappointed because Harry Potter is such an insanely high bar to get right for a game. I'll probably pick it up one day, but it sounded like yet another game that was released before it was fully baked and I'm done with that. 

I had forgotten how much fun a more linear, less open-world game can be when developers can put more time into creating lots of enemy variety, which so many newer games seem to overlook. It's obviously silly to directly compare a new 2023 title to a remake of a 21YO game, but this remake is one of the best games I've played in a really long time. It still has its flaws (I wish there was a harder mode), but it's a great reminder of what games used to be like before cosmetics, pay-to-win, weird social media nods, etc. And Nintendo priced it incredibly well. I'll take a $40 flawless remake over a $70 disappointment any day.",MagicFlyingMachine,1,15,80,229,1275,0,0

To get the extra 10$ off, I purchased Nintendo gift cards from Costco, where they are sold 100$ worth for 80$, where it essentially becomes 40$ per game voucher using Costco. 

If you already have both memberships, I would highly recommend doing it this way. You could look at it from the point of spending 80$ for it, but you get a second game full price to balance it out. I’m sure there might be a way to get the price cheaper, but this is the method I used! Hope this is useful advice for someone out there!",Boekster,1,7,25,124,673,0,0

10zruff,"Why did 3D All-Stars, a compilation of three amazing games, draw such ire while Metroid Prime Remastered is so praised?","Obviously the timed release thing is pretty bad. No one will defend that.

Super Mario 3D All-Stars put three of the best Mario games ever into one collection. Two of the games had never been re-released before. The three games remained mostly unchanged, which is common for just about every compilation ever, and the only major alterations involved the new controllers. This is, and I'm being serious, objectively good.

But for some reason, people hate it for this. Some people wanted massive changes to Super Mario 64, even though this is meant to be a compilation including the original game. Many complainers also griped about the removal of some glitches used in speedruns (which isn't even a removal because it's based on the Japanese version which didn't have the glitches anyway), such as backwards longjumping up the stairs. Most of the people that complain about this aren't speedrunners, and speedrunners weren't going to be playing this over the original anyway. Nevertheless, this apparently ""took away everything fun about the game"". I've seen someone genuinely make that comment. Do these people just not know how compilations work or something?

Meanwhile, you have the new Metroid Prime Remastered. I love Metroid Prime, and it's a very pretty remaster. But it's super disappointing that it isn't the full trilogy, and instead is just the single game. The new Direct had news about several enhanced ports that are always bundled with sequels, but Prime, which was previously bundled with its sequels, is standing alone. What we have here is just a shiny port of a single GameCube game. Sure it has a couple good accessibility features, but it's still just a single game. A single game that is, besides the subjectively prettier graphics, exactly the same as its GameCube counterpart.

So what's with the hypocrisy? The same people that complained about Mario 64 being the same, except for glitches most people don't use, are praising the Metroid Prime remaster for simple existing, even though it's an expensive port. At least Mario 64 also included Sunshine and Galaxy. Was $60 too much for those three games? Maybe. But I think $40 is also too much for Metroid Prime. And if they eventually remaster Prime 2 and 3, that's cool. $120 for Metroid Prime Trilogy. Yeah, and you say 3D All-Stars was overpriced.

Personally, I don't care for single re-releases of classic games. I feel the exact same way about Link's Awakening and Skyward Sword. We're WAY past the point where these games need to be by themselves, and that's especially true for Metroid Prime. That's why 3D All-Stars doesn't deserve the criticism that it gets. It's a collection of three of the best Mario games ever. That's all it is, and it's all that it needs to be. Galaxy 2 would've been nice tho. But for what it is, it's perfectly fine.

Tl;dr - People hate the ports of three games never released together, but love the port of one game that was released with sequels. This is dumb.",uknownada,1,20,119,504,2974,0,0

10za34t,The Nintendo DS might be the next and also the last console to be added into the online service.,"Up until recently, I always believed that Nintendo added their retro games in a cloud server so that everyone that used their online service could play them, but recently I was told that the games are actually downloaded into the console vía updates.

That made me realize something, Nintendo has to keep in mind the Switch storage (32 gb, 64 in oled) and that's why it wasn't until recently that they released a game (TotK) that surpasses 16gb of storage (which might explain why the game is $10 more expensive since the game card holds 32 gb instead of 16 and the policy that Nintendo manages forces digital games to cost as much as physical games, which also explains why terraria was $50 dollars until the physical release stopped) and this affects the online service as well since ever since the gamecube (for home console devices) and the 3ds (for handhelds), it's weird to not find a first party game that takes at least 1gb of storage size, which means that in terms of what console would join the service next, there's only one option left if they want to help save storage.

The DS games, I wouldn't call them small, but very few games reached the maximun storage capacity which was 512mb (which you would need 2 games of that size in order to get 1gb), because cartridges were expensive and it was a portable device (meaning devs didn't get crazy with the ds).

I was initially worried about the dual-screen since the Nintendo Switch has only one screen but they could add that option the Wii U had which allowed for the two screens to be displayed in one screen.

The only problem that I think is unavoidable, is the same one that Pokemon Cafe has, that you're forced to use the console on portable mode since the TV mode lacks a touch screen, I hope Nintendo sells an add-on to fix that problem.

10zc3a3,Stop blaming inflation for TotK being priced at $70,"If you've taken a rudimentary economics course, you know that the market clearing price is determined by the intersection of consumers' willingness to pay (demand) and producers' capacity to sell (supply).

While cost-push inflation is certainly possible, game companies generally have low overhead, with nearly all its budget going to labor costs. Wage growth [has fallen short of CPI](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/why-salaries-in-the-united-states-dont-keep-up-with-inflation-.html) since interest rates started rising. So, whatever theoretical cost that publishers are ""passing on to the consumer"" should track lower than inflation.

Furthermore, the inflation argument seemingly ignores the entire price history of games. Nominally speaking, the MSRP of triple-A games has remained flat at $59.99 since at least the early 1990s, meaning that the price of games has actually decreased in real terms. There are many reasons for this, including:

1. Competing digital entertainment options for customers (e.g. streaming services, smartphone apps/games)
2. New development tools including automation
3. A larger talent base of game developers that has reduced the cost of skilled labor

Are any of these economic drivers any less relevant now than a few years ago? Perhaps #3 is *slightly* curtailed by wage growth. But anyone who applies a broad metric like CPI to explain a price increase of a Zelda game has a poor intuitive grasp of economics.

A far more plausible explanation is that Nintendo is merely opportunistic, and understands that a mid- to late-cycle Zelda game is likely to appeal more to hardcore fans, who exhibit greater willingness to pay. This is a form of third-degree [price discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination). We saw the exact same thing with Majora's Mask, which had an MSRP of $79.99 upon its release in October 2000. Yet, no one would cite that as an example of inflation.

There is nothing inherently wrong with this; it is simply market forces at play. But attributing the price increase to inflation is simply ignorant.

oh there is an OUTRAGE !!! an HAAAAAATREEEED towards Nintendo for DARING to increase the game price to 70 USD over 60 USD. and I feel like I am taking crazy pills because games USED TO COST 70 USD if not more when I was a kid, I paid 70 USD for Zelda Link to the past, Ocarina of time I also paid 70, 7O for Wind Waker and I even paid 80 hard earned Dollars for Majora's Mask.

yet people at like Kotaku claims $70 Tears Of The Kingdom is the first game to ever cost 70 USD from Nintendo LOL

Not only that I used to pay even more for games that I had to import like half my JRPG collection I had to import as they where not released where I grow up, so I paid like 100+ USD for games back in the 90s.

THAT IS WITHOUT COUNTING FOR INFLATION, with inflation a game for 70 USD should cost like 140 USD to today. So I paid like 200 USD for same games, yet people wanna boycott for Nintendo for increasing Zelda by 10 bucks? have you guys bought groceries this latest year?

So imagine me paying 110 USD for Legend of Mana back in like 1999 and how I really dont see its a big issue having to pay 10 more usd for an amazing game like Zelda where I know the DOLLAR PER HOUR value is massive.

That being said do the Zelda tears of kingdom collector's edition is overpriced, there they added like 30-50 more USD for no reason, way too much.

10ybyix,"Reminder: Even at $70, video games are cheaper than they've ever been.","I've seen a lot of discussion about Nintendo charging $70 for Tears of the Kingdom and wanted to raise a few points and essentially show that it's reasonable to expect to pay that much for a game in 2023.

1. Inflation: The simple reality is, your money is worth less than it used to be. Using this [inflation calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm) you can see that even looking at inflation from 2018 to now, $70 is a reasonable price to pay for something that was $60 in 2018. **$60 in 2018 = $70.88 now**.

2. This isn't the first time games have been $70. Look at [this](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DS5_OlmVQAEsPRG.jpg&imgrefurl=https://twitter.com/VGArtAndTidbits/status/949836469744619520&tbnid=bVpwf8S5JCn8tM&vet=1&docid=rFxctqkORacdQM&w=884&h=1200&source=sh/x/im) catalogue of Nintendo 64 games. You'll see that both DK 64 and Perfect Dark were being sold for $69.99 in 1999! That's equivalent to $123.44 today!! Even ""expensive"" games today are ludicrously cheaper than they were years ago. For example [Ocarina of Time](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/524458319089222844/) was sold for $60, **$108.65 today**. Even SNES games like [Street Fighter 2 Alpha](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/n822tu/toys_r_us_super_nintendo_ad_circa_1996/) were $70 (**$130.99 today**), $60 for Donkey Kong Country III ($112.28), or just for Zelda comparison, $50 for [Link to the Past](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/huguesjohnsoncom-electronics-boutique-spring-1993-catalog--106116134942054622/) ($101.78 today).

3. Games cost more to produce. While prices have remained stagnant (ie decreasing accounting for inflation), production budgets have exploded. Games like Zelda could be made by a team of 25 in the 90s and that's simply no longer the case. Now you have 100s of staff working on games that have even longer development cycles. While I'll acknowledge that the popularity of games has led to selling games for lower prices being more feasible (just because more people playing games = more people buying games = more profit, even at a lower price point), this can only be true to a certain extent. Not to mention, because of increased production costs/values, you're getting more bang for your buck. Today you get beautifully crafted world that will take 100s of hours to explore vs a game that could be beat in a tenth of the time that you'd get 20 years ago.

4. Nintendo has [promised](https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-union-pay-raise-layoffs-pokemon-scarlet-1850082365) a 10% raise for its employees. In a time of record inflation and huge layoffs in the rest of the tech world, this is the sort of behavior that we should be happy to see from a corporation like Nintendo. Of course, those raises must be paid for somehow.

All in all, I get that it sucks to pay $70 bucks for a game when you're expecting it to be $60, and it sucks that video games, formerly seemingly free of inflation, are now being impacted by it. Despite this, it's totally reasonable to expect the price of games to increase as time goes on, and Nintendo or any other publisher is not ""price gouging"" or being ""evil"" by doing so.

TL;DR: Looking at inflation, production budgets of today, and even just raw price comparisons, video games have never been cheaper than they are right now.",pianoguy212,1,12,70,487,3333,0,0

10x78ya,Recently finished Red Steel and quite enjoyed it.,"I've been wanting to play this game since reading about it in Nintendo Power in 2006 but I was unsure about the idea of motion controls so I ended up getting a 360 at the time but many years later I finally got a Wii U and a bunch of Wii games and this year i finally got around to playing Red Steel and I ended up enjoying it. I was actually surprised by how in-depth the story was, yeah it's a little bit cliched but it was engaging enough that I was able to look past that(I even got the good ending). The sword fights actually got easier as the game went along IMO as you learned all those new techniques, as soon as I learned the hammer move I pretty much relied on that to end up fights as it was way easier then trying to drain the enemies health. I personally didn't bother sparing any of the enemies in sword fights as I found I gained plenty of honor elsewhere. That first fight with Ryuichi(the one you aren't scripted to lose)ended up being the hardest one for me because without your fancy techniques it gets to be a real pain, my arm was tired by the time I was done with him.

I was also surprised by the variety in the levels, I particularly enjoyed the gaming district with that one crazy guy and his Saw-esque traps.

For a launch-title this is damn impressive, graphically it's not that great compared to other games of it's time but it does have nice destruction physics on occasion. This is definitely one property I hope Ubisoft resurrects one of these days. Hope part 2 is good as well, i've heard it's pretty thin plot wise but better in terms of gameplay so I guess i'll see.",pspartoutsr,1,8,49,306,1600,0,0

As a result of this, it seems Bandai Namco has opted to not translate the second game into any of these languages. This means that you cannot play the second game in the same language you played the first game if you play in a FIGS language.

However, both games seem to be getting **all new** translations into Chinese and Korean. Neither game was originally playable in Chinese or Korean.

Personally, I think this is unacceptable, and speakers of these languages should voice their disapproval with this decision.

10wx8ud,Fifty OUTLANDISH predictions for the Feb '23 Nintendo Direct,"Hi r/Nintendo!

I've put together a list of some of the potential things we might see in today's direct, as mentioned by various games media outlets, Reddit, YouTube, Twitter rumours etc.

Now - I'm not a moron, this is quite clearly just speculation, and just for fun.

I'm not delusional enough to think that even a quarter of these things will happen, but it's Direct season and the hype is real. Happy gaming folks.

# The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

The safest bet; lock it in. One of two things is going to happen here: either we get a decent amount of info on the game and a confirmation of release date, or – the announcement of a ToTK-dedicated Direct to air in the next couple of months. , perhaps even next week. I'm leaning heavily towards the latter. There’s also the potential for that leaked Zelda model OLED to be revealed - if it is indeed legit. 

# Mario

**New 2D Super Mario** – lots of chat about this. The movie is drumming up hype, and releasing a new game alongside it makes a lot of sense. Sounding likely. 

**New 3D Super Mario** – it’s been five and a half years since Odyssey. People have been asking for this for a while, but *surely* it makes more sense to have the next big 3D Mario release as a launch title alongside the next console, whenever that might be. Of course, I could be wrong, but I don’t see it lining up. Will be an awesome title to kick off the next generation. 

**New Mario Movie footage** – not long to go now. Quite possible we get another short trailer here.

**Super Mario Galaxy 2 port** – don’t think it’s going to happen, simply because it should have already happened. There’s always the potential though, and if this is going to be a Mario-heavy direct as I suspect, there’s a chance for this – not to mention the other legions of Mario games that haven’t yet made their way to the Switch. 

**New Mario Sports title** –  Confident on this. Golf was announced in Feb 2021 and Strikers in Feb 2022. Baseball (Sluggers) and basketball (Hoops) would be the frontrunners, but I’d also be curious to see a Mario take on ice hockey or American football. The dream would be a game that included all four sports, but that would take some effort, and that might be asking too much. Something seems likely though.

&#x200B;

# DLC

**Xenoblade Chronicles 3 DLC** – announcement of next wave is coming. Possibly today.

**Mario Kart 8 Deluxe DLC** – announcement of next wave is coming. Probably today.

**Splatoon 3 DLC** – announcement of expansion is coming. Probably today.

**Fire Emblem Engage** **DLC** \- announcement of next wave is coming. Maybe today.

**Super Mario Party DLC** – it’s been a while, but it’s certainly still possible. Cautiously optimistic here. 

**Pokemon Scarlet/Violet** **DLC** – it’s going to happen, but more likely it’ll be announced in a Pokemon Presents in the next few months. There’s also those rumours of Detective Pikachu 2.

# Nintendo Switch Online

**New N64 Titles** – there’s a handful of already confirmed games that are yet to be added to the service, and until they are, don’t expect any more announcements.

**New SNES Titles, namely Chrono Trigger / Super Mario RPG** – the two glaring omissions from the SNES on NSO library. Earthbound was announced during a direct, it’s certainly possible at least one of these games finally sees the light today.

**GameBoy / GameBoy Advance added to NSO** – we might finally be seeing this today. Lots of smoke here – another cause for cautious optimism.  

**GameCube added** \- very strong nope. Would be amazing though.

**NSO adds current-gen games** – pure speculation on my part here, but in a big year for GamePass and PlayStation’s PS+ service, Nintendo might feel pressured to add more value to their own online service by adding current-gen games monthly, even if they’re four/five/six years old. No evidence behind this, but it seems like a good idea to keep up with the competition. 

# Switch debuts

**New F-Zero** – can’t see it. Personally think that it would be much better suited to stronger hardware, but that’s an even bigger stretch. Little bit of chat about it but personally I don’t buy it.

**New Star Fox** – same as F-zero. I give them both less than a 5% chance of appearing. 

**New Donkey Kong**  – never any hard evidence, yet frustratingly gets brought up before every single Direct… because of course it should! It’s a sensible prediction! DK is one of Nintendo’s big boys – why hasn’t he had a new game in almost a decade?!? It’s not like they’ve retired the franchise!....Having said that, I’m smart enough to not let myself believe we’ll see a new DK game today. 

And having said \*that\*, I’m dumb enough to believe we \*will\* see a new DK game later in the year. (Seriously though, what’s going on with the big ape?)

**New Kid Icarus** – unlikely I think. Would be a nice surprise, and it’s not impossible, but really don’t think it’ll happen. 

**New Wario / Waluigi game** – one out of left field. Nintendo loves new IP, and the anti-Mario bros haven’t had their own big game to star in yet. This is an absolute guess, obviously, and extremely unlikely, but it would be nice to give them \*some\* sort of legacy on the Switch.  

**New Ice Climbers** – what? No. I mean, *yes please*, but no. I saw someone predict this. If it was you, reading this now - are you feeling okay?

# Remasters/Ports

**Metroid Prime HD** – anybody seen the clown makeup? Throw it over here please. Seriously though, the only glimmer of hope left is this not-that-crazy idea that Nintendo are waiting to showcase the remaster alongside the first Prime 4 trailer in order to drive up hype. I’ll believe it when I see it.That’s a lie, I already believe it #clowned

**Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition** \- one of the last Wii U games left. Unlikely at this point in time. 

**TLOZ: The Wind Waker + Twilight Princess** – no. would’ve already happened. Especially not now ith TOTK so close on the horizon. Would love to be wrong.

**Tomb Raider Collection** – possible.

**Tomodachi Life** – don’t see it happening. 

**Batman Arkham Trilogy** – was seemingly leaked quite a while ago by a ratings board. Seems very plausible. 

**Pikmin 1 & 2** – feel like it would’ve happened alongside the port of Pikmin 3 if it was ever going to. It’s possible that they come out in the leadup to 4, but I’m pretty cold on this. Still - wouldn’t be too crazy of an announcement.  

# Remakes

**Unconfirmed Fire Emblem remake** – been talk for years of an old FE being remade and most “insiders” seem to push the idea that the series fourth entry, Genealogy of the Holy War, is the one in line for a complete ground-up rework. It’s one of the few games in the series still locked to Japan and would be a huge release, but to announce this while Engage is this new and shiny would be super weird, even for Nintendo. 

(Interestingly, the person who leaked FE:E info and screenshots (which proved to be true) also claimed this remake was *also* happening, but despite all the smoke it’s just too unlikely. Any classic Fire Emblem remake would be fantastic but I can’t see it happening soon. Not this year, anyway. 

**Mother (anything**) – biggest ‘hint’ here is that the Earthbound plushies have gone back on sale. Other than that there’s nothing here. Would be cool, is possible - but still very unlikely.

**Baten Kaitos** – niche cult game but there’s been some stuff floating around that suggests a remake is on the cards. Who knows.

# Release Dates

**Outer Wilds** – two years since the announcement and we’ve heard nothing. If it’s coming, now would be a good time to let people know.

**Advance Wars 1+2 Boot Camp** – it’s there. It’s ready. SURELY they do a quick little trailer, announcing the game’s release as either a shadow drop post-Direct or coming within the next month or so.

**Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters** – release confirmed, just awaiting a date. Today seems as a good a time as any. 

**Hogwarts Legacy** – Switch version needs more time to cook; still, might get a window for this.

**Deltarune** – new chapters are on their way. Possible announcement.

# The Confirmed Heavy Hitters

**Metroid Prime 4**  – We know it exists, and that with each passing direct it becomes slightly more likely that it’ll show up. Hopes aren’t sky high but it’s certainly within the realms of possibility. 

**Pikmin 4** – got the little teaser last time, should see a bit more this time. The 2023 release window could mean May (as rumoured) or could mean December, so how much is shown now (if any) is up in the air, but it’ll very likely be in this Direct in some way, shape or form.

**Hollow Knight Silksong** – I actually feel pretty confident about this. Microsoft basically confirmed it would be out by June, and with only four months left when better to announce a release date? The hype train is probably too big for an Indie World direct, so I expect to see the long awaited reveal here.

**Hades 2** \- it's early, but there's a chance a Switch release is confirmed along with a release window. 

# Surprise Sequels

**Astral Chain 2** – AC did well enough commercially and critically to warrant a sequel, but with all the focus on Bayonetta as of late it seems pretty doubtful. Maybe one day? Would be a pretty cool announcement to come out nowhere though. 

**Arms 2** – the first game actually did pretty well for itself, and it's been years now. Is there enough life in the concept to expand the franchise further? I don't think so, but I'm usually wrong. 

**Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker 2:** Sleeper hit (although originally a Wii U game) that could very likely spawn another title. Don't rule it out.

**Ring Fit Adventure 2 / Ring Hero** – over 14 million units of RFA were sold, meaning there are over 14 million rings in people’s homes. That seems like enough for Nintendo’s creative team to put something together. Maybe a direct sequel that comes with a compact treadmill, maybe a rhythm game, maybe even a party game. Seems a waste to not have more uses for the ring! Unlikely, not impossible.

**Luigi's Mansion 4** – LM has done enough to cement itself as a solid Nintendo franchise going forward. LM4 is happening, it’s just a question of when. Seems unlikely to be coming now, but it’s one to keep in the back of your mind. Very small chance of a surprise reveal. 

**1-2 Switch 2 / 3-4 Switch** – another one that’s had some chat around it. I neither know nor care.

# The big shot in the dark

**TimeSplitters 4** – there’s a grainy photo of an office wall with characters on it that’s been floating around.  With that in mind, consider this 100% confirmed to be at the direct.

Seriously though I’d sacrifice (almost) everything else on this list for a glimpse of TS4.

# and of course...

**New Super Nintendo Switch Pro** – No... but OOOOO can you imagine?

&#x200B;

and there you go!

Anything I missed? What would you most like to see? What do you think is likely?

I'm hoping at least 7 or 8 of these come true - I think that qualifies me as an insider for life.

10w8iay,Everyone remind themselves of the typical Direct format before tomorrow,"Every time a general direct comes around, I always see the complaints that it wasted too much time on smaller games.  But every direct we've had for a while now has followed this same format:

Cold Open: Brand new game.  First five minutes. (Sept 2022: Fire Emblem Engage)

5-7 minutes of Nintendo Switch Headlines.  Usually indie/3rd party stuff, maybe some DLC for 1st party games thrown in there.

New game reveal, or info on previously announced game.  Sometimes a major 3rd party exclusive (Sept 2022: Octopath 2)

10 more minutes of Nintendo Switch Headlines.

New game reveal, or info on previously announced game. (Sept 2022: Pikmin 4)

10 more minutes of Nintendo Switch Headlines.

Second to last thing is often a trailer of a first party game (Sept 2022: Kirby Return to Dreamland Deluxe)

The last announcement.  ""One last thing"".  Usually the biggest, most hype thing of the Direct.  (Sept 2022: Tears of the Kingdom title reveal and release date trailer)

So keep expectations in check, and realize the Direct will likely only focus on 3-4 major first party or third party exclusives, which overall will take up less than half of the Direct's runtime.  Over half of the Direct is focused on smaller announcements.",jabber822,1,10,71,205,1227,0,0

10xvs0l,Link's Awakening DX on Nintendo Switch Online made me raise an eyebrow. Why it needs to exist?,"I was happy when they announced that both Gameboy (including Gameboy Color) and Gameboy Advance games would be added to Nintendo Switch Online, but when they announced Metroid Prime Remastered right after that announcement I realized that Link's Awakening DX was going to coexist with the remake of Link's Awakening on Nintendo Switch, and that created a question: What's the point? The remake is definitely the superior way to play Link's Awakening and yet they added the Gameboy Color version as well? Why? I think it generates more losses tham gains so it's not worth it.

I was able to understand Super Mario Advance 4 cause despite being Super Mario Bros 3 from Super Mario All Stars all over again, it includes the e reader levels and similar to Bowser's Fury, that's pretty much it's own game so most people would want to play that game for those levels alone, but with Link's Awakening, I don't know if it's different enough to justify playing an inferior version of the game.

But that's not the only question I had after watching that announcement, cause that also made me wonder if this was going to happen again in the future. For example Advance Wars appearing on the service despite having a remake released by the time that happens, I would not see a point for that.

And if more consoles are going to be added in the service, they we may also get Metroid Prime on a future Gamecube service even though a remaster just came out, Xenoblade 1 and Kirby Return to Dreamland on a future wii service even though they both got a remaster and a remake respectively, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl on a DS service despite having a remake on Nintendo Switch already, Miitopia on a 3DS service despite having a rerelease on Nintendo Switch already, and I don't think I need to give ANY example for the Wii U cause there's plenty already. I think my point is pretty clear.

I just don't understand why Link's Awakening DX needs to be on Nintendo Switch when we have the remake, and if Nintendo keeps doing things like that then I don't know how this will benefit the company at all, It may only cause a money loss cause I highly doubt that the gains would be that big.

Then only making it $40?!?! Oh my god that is so awesome especially when Nintendo loves to overprice things. 




I am going to go as far as to saying that this is the biggest thing Nintendo has ever done. Yes of course if they did this with a Mario or Zelda game it’d be crazier but again Metroid is not some little league game so this is a big deal in it’s self.

 * ***Spitball Sparky*** was released in 1982 for the Game & Watch Super Color in Japan. In this action game, developed by *Nintendo R&D1*, move Sparky left and right, using the ball to destroy all the blocks on the screen. When the ball passes into the purple area, use the shooter button to spit the ball back into the air. You get one point for each green block cleared, two points for each blue block and three points for each red block. Red blocks take two hits to clear. In Game B, blocks appear and disappear, and can only be hit when they are visible.

   
   
 * ***Nintendo Puzzle Collection*** was released in 2003 for the Nintendo GameCube in Japan. In this puzzle compilation of *Dr. Mario*; *Yoshi's Cookie* and *Panel de Pon*, developed by *Nintendo Software Technology*, all three games have been updated with new graphics, sound and single and multiplayer game modes. It is also possible to send versions of each game to the Game Boy Advance using the GameCube-GBA Link Cable.

10uehdl,"Looking back, what are your overall thoughts on Kirby’s 30th anniversary celebration from Nintendo?","2022 marked the 30th anniversary of the Kirby franchise, as the original Dream Land came out for the Game Boy in 1992. And in recent years, HAL Labs have been putting Nintendo to shame when it comes to celebrating their flagship franchise’s big milestones. Back on Wii we were treated to the sublime Kirby’s Dream Collection, which blew Mario and Zelda’s 25th anniversary offerings out of the water. And now history seems to repeat itself 10 years later, so let’s see what the pink puffball had to offer us for his 30th birthday:

**[Kirby and the Forgotten Land](https://youtu.be/H3LAkr0ANgw):** It’s been a long time coming, but Kirby has finally made the transition to 3D. Set in an unknown post-apocalyptic cityscape, this game was structured more like Mario 3D World than Odyssey. This was the beginning of what folks at HAL referred to as the “next phase” of the Kirby franchise, and the public response was euphoric. It sold over 5 million copies worldwide and even won Best Family Game at the Game Awards that year.

**[Kirby 64 The Crystal Shards](https://youtu.be/0VfAsbGvXrA):** Back in May, the pink puff’s N64 debut was released to subscribers of the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. While this game was rendered with full 3D visuals, it was still a 2.5D platformer all things considered. The big difference between this and the rest of the series was that Kirby can fuse two different copy abilities into a single new one, something that was only barely revisited in later entries.

**[Kirby’s Dream Buffet](https://youtu.be/qOGQv0hJNJ8):** Well this was certainly unexpected. In the summer of 2022, Kirby got a new multiplayer focused game out of nowhere. And the goal was to eat as much food as you can and out-fat your opponents across a series of obstacle courses. There have been plenty of comparisons to Fall Guys, but unlike that game this one was a self contained release for $15 USD that only supports up to 4 players max.

**[Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe](https://youtu.be/zAQZY2UVcoQ):** I don’t think this was on anyone’s bingo card any more than Dream Buffet. The 2011 Wii hit Kirby’s Return to Dream Land, also known as Kirby’s Adventure Wii in Europe, is getting a full blown remaster on the Switch in only a few weeks! It’s certainly a much more ambitious remaster job than the basic touch-ups that Mario Galaxy and Skyward Sword got, as this one is actually getting brand new content. We can expect new copy abilities, new sub-games, and online play! Wait… wait what do you mean there’s not gonna be online play for the main game…?",Asad_Farooqui,1,14,99,432,2575,0,0

10u8kx2,My theory about Super Mario Bros Movie storyline. Spoiler warning??,"**To cut to the chase; Chris Pratt's Mario is not *THE SUPER MARIO*, thus the different voice.**

My theory is that the actual Mario disappeared some time ago and now this random guy from Brooklyn with an M on his hat who happens to look like Mario stumbles into Mushroom Kingdom and has to take Mario's place as the hero. This is also why Chris's Mario looks slightly.... off. 

Peach seems to know that it's not the real Mario and she tries her best to keep that a secret from the citizens (For Morale) and now she has to train him in secret which is why we see the training sequence in the trailer with just Mario and Peach.

This theory is also heavily supported by the Donkey Kong fight scene in the second trailer. In the beginning of the scene Chris's Mario focuses and quietly says to himself the classic Mario line **""Let's-a-go""** as if he's trying to channel the actual Mario he's been told about by Peach.

We also never see any back-n-forth dialogue interaction between Mario and the other Mushroom Kingdom citizens. I'm guessing this is to hide the fact that they mistakenly think that he is the actual Mario.

Charles Martinet (Mario's voice from the games) has been confirmed to have lines in the movie, but when asked about it he was very secretive. My theory is that he is voicing the ACTUAL Super Mario when he is saved at the end of the movie. This is an excellent way to give fans what they want without destroying their ears with the constant over-the-top italian accent.

As for the interaction between Luigi and Bowser, it seems like Bowser is also aware that the new Mario Brothers are fake (Probably because he had a hand in capturing the original Brothers before his invasion) which is why he starts with **""Not sure if you know who I am""** Another theory is that Luigi is actually the real Luigi and Bowser is saying that line sarcastically. However the poster showing Luigi in Brooklyn with Mario sort of debunks this theory. Then again it could be a misdirection by the PR team. Point is, Luigi is a bit of a wildcard atm.

I'm just getting the vibe that all the dialogue that is shown in the trailer is just so perfectly and carefully selected to hide this plot twist from us. Thing is, if I was given a chance to make The Super Mario movie, I would do something really, *truly* special with the franchise (like what I theorized) instead of something.... boring and expected. They have one chance to make something unforgettable.

Anyway, with this theory in mind they can have a lot of fun, like including [""Mario's Missing!""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Is_Missing!) jokes as well as include stuff from Luigi's Mansion where Luigi has to save Mario from inside the painting.

**Am I overthinking this? Let me know what you think. Btw this is not a leak. This is a fan theory. I have no idea if others have already come up with this idea or not. Have a good day :)**",Mottis86,1,10,67,520,2906,0,0

10tk6tv,Pay attention to Super Mario Galaxy 2,"I just played through Super Mario Galaxy 2 again for the first time since its release, and I think it is criminally underrated among fans.

I say fans, not critics, because it's right next to SMG on the rating list. But I feel as if many fans either didn't play it, or claim that because it ""didn't have a story"" it's worse than the original. But I just have to vent. When, EVER, has a Mario game been about the story? Like, seriously? It's the exact same plot every time, who cares? Of any series in gaming, Super Mario has been about the gameplay. I think they finally decided to embrace that by creating essentially a non-story to focus fully on the level design. And I firmly believe the level design is the best of any 3D Mario game.

The motion controls are used perfectly - not overdone, but provides moments where you want to stand on feet and focus to complete a task. Bringing in Yoshi added so many hilarious, fun moments and new ways to push the platforming. And holy shit, the power-ups were used PERFECTLY throughout the course of the game. The creativity behind some of these levels were simply incredible.

I think the most important factor in making SMG2 a true improvement over the original and the games that have come since then is that unlike any other 3D Mario, it is honest-to-god fucking difficult. It sneaks up on you - certainly at the beginning as you're racking up countless 1UP mushrooms. But every time you quit the game you got back to four lives, and as the game goes on you realize that the developers had no fear in letting you die A LOT. I genuinely appreciated how hard some of the challenges are in the game, and I don't think we've had that level of difficulty in a Mario game since then. Case and point is The Perfect Run. Easily the hardest Star I've earned in any platformer.

Sorry, just had to get this off my chest. If you haven't played it yet - find a way to. It is platforming perfection and deserves its flowers.",ArmenianPie,1,7,37,362,1960,0,0

* Buying physical means less money for Nintendo! Digital games are often full price and 100% of the sale goes to the publisher. If I could, I would setup my direct deposit to go to Nintendo's bank account lol
* Physical games are HEAVY! Have you tried picking up one of these or better yet using a multi-cart case? I'm a gamer, not an olympic athlete!
* No social pressures to lend out my games to friends/family. When I buy physical games, people always want to borrow my games. But with digital I don't need to worry about that!
* I'm very environmentally conscience and production of game cartridges has a detrimental effect on the Earth so I avoid those like the plague.

Getting the ball to the opponent's touchline, or kicking it over their goal, is the way to score.

10smvvx,Gripe with Super Mario 3D All Stars Limited Release,"Hi,

I recently learned of Super Mario 3D All-Stars on Nintendo Switch. I even more recently learned that it was only a 6-month limited release.

I just wanted to express my discontent at the fact that this was a limited release. I would have gladly paid $150 for this bundle if it were available now – particularly since I've never played Super Mario Sunshine. Unfortunately for Nintendo, I'm now forced to use piratical options, instead.

If you too feel similar discontent, please comment to make your voice heard.

Edit: I am talking about the ***digital copy***. Some of us just want digitial copies, and digital copies only man. I'm sorry if this offends anyone...",pepsimaximo1,1,9,51,114,670,0,0

Which Studio would you pick and What would be the Tone of the Series how true to the games would it be? Would developers consult so it's  in line with the games?  
Like Fire Emblem would each season cover different game in the Series?  Besides current titles What classic Nintendo game needs an Anime?

10rss3a,I think it's time for Nintendo to make a Mario American football game.,"I've been a fan of both American football and more sports games and so does my dad and my brother though myself when it comes to games like Madden for as long as I can remember. I'm more of a memorial sports fan, but it's a shame that there hasn't been a proper American football game on the switch. The last time we saw a Madden game on a Nintendo console was mad in 13 for the weed and we you which was released back in 2012 that's over a decade without a single Madden game on any of the Nintendo's consoles from the Wii u all the way up till the switch since 2012.

Not only is American football, a popular sport in the United States, but it's also gained a growing following in other countries such as the UK, Germany, Mexico and Japan. In fact, Japan has their own American football type leagues and play very similar games to American football and they've been doing this since the 1930s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_League

And with this, I think that a Mario sports game based on American football would do really well with the growing fan base of American football and the lack of an American football game than the Nintendo switch

So here is my concept for a super Mario American football game


Game play:

The game we can buy an elements of traditional American football games such as Madden and the wackiness of other Mario sports games like super strikers

Players would have the option to play in traditional mode similar to Madden where they would play as Mario characters or me characters any more serious realistic American football game void of all the wackiness of a Mario game for those that want to more traditional gameplay style or in a wacky Mario mode where they would play with the typical over the top whimsical elements that are found in Mario sports games.

And wacky mode players would have access to power ups and abilities that are not typically seen in football games. Traditionally like Madden such as the ability to grow in size or throw a bunch of fireballs at the opposing team via power-ups as well as having special abilities for things such as kicking end zones or tackling opponents like in Mario strikers games

I don't really have to say too much for the traditional mode for you of those that know football and how the game works. It'd be the traditional basic game. Nothing fancy

Teams:

The teams would consist of characters from a variety of different Mario games that have been in various different Mario sports games with the ability to play as mii characters and everything.

It'd be the typical thing where each character has their own advantages disadvantages all that stuff. Yada yada.

The characters would also have upgradable outfits in the game similar to super strikers battle league in terms of having different uniforms

One cool feature that could be brought back for the teams is the ability to create your own team logo similar to how you could create a design for your go-kart in Mario kart DS or you could stick with the ones given to you in the game

Stadiums: 

Another aspect of Mario game such as the strikers series is stadiums for the players. There could be stadiums with different things like pipes to go through throughout the field that allow you to dodge tackles and there could be ones with platforms that are higher to get a higher advantage in the air and there could be stadiums with obstacles such as piranha plants that come out of the ground at random times to obstruct players as they are running across the field

Having something with obstacles like I mentioned, such as piranha plants coming up out of the ground, would in turn keep players on their toes and make the gameplay vastly different from any other type of football game based on American football

Overall, I would love to see Nintendo do this. I highly doubt they ever will but for me and my family my dad doesn't really have the money to go out and purchase a PlayStation 4 or 5 or the newest Xbox and everything like that to be able to play Madden and it's not really cost effective to buy it if he's only going to play that one game. So it would be cool if Nintendo could do a partnership with the NFL and have NFL teams. But I highly doubt with EA sports having a monopoly on games because they make Madden that will never happen, but it would be cool. I'd like to hear your ideas and your thoughts based on the information I provided and any other ideas that you have",Drawesome045,1,13,70,802,4428,0,0

One interesting thing he said is that people often skip a major step in terms of portability, starting with the most powerful version and going straight to the least powerful version. But with Hogwarts Legacy they will do a gradual porting, little by little, starting with PS5, then PS4 and only then Nintendo Switch. So I believe this could be good news for anyone waiting to play this on the Nintendo Switch :)

10q16e8,Hot take: I’m not really excited for any more upcoming Mario sports games.,"With rumors of a [new Mario Baseball game](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/mario-sports-baseball-sluggers-nintendo-switch-game-leaked/) coming later this year, I’ve seen a lot of initial reactions that have been pretty lukewarm to the idea nowadays. And I can’t help but agree with them. Ever since 2011, we’ve gotten at least one new Mario sports game every single year, with the only completely vacant year being 2020. And the quality of each of these sports games have varied wildly. At their best, I feel they can rival some of the best Mario spinoff games ever made. And at their worst they are pure filler, meant to eat up a calendar slot until the next big release rolls around. So let’s take a quick look back at every Mario sports game to have come out in the past 10 years or so and see what we think of them in retrospect:

**[Mario Sports Mix](https://youtu.be/XEla32-TCA4):** Made by Square Enix and brings together 4 different sports in one. A fun distraction and got some cool minigames, but I’m not revisiting this anytime soon. At least it gave me the opportunity to dunk on a Behemoth from Final Fantasy using the power of volleyball.

**[Mario Tennis Open](https://youtu.be/LEs1wZohOpo):** Clearly a byproduct of Nintendo needing to push out more games for the 3DS following its first major price cut. The new chance shots completely dominate the gameplay and it feels more like you’re a cat chasing a laser toy. Not one I’m keen on checking out.

**[Mario & Sonic Sochi 2014](https://youtu.be/F0GROJ1F41E):** It’s the first Mario & Sonic game in HD yet somehow looks worse than the London game before it. I’ve never played this series and I don’t have any intentions on starting anytime soon. Surprisingly though, a 3DS companion version does not exist.

**[Mario Golf World Tour](https://youtu.be/5LfPg9lpx2k):** Actually amazing and super underrated. If your biggest complaints about recent Mario sports games are the lack of content on day 1 and the lack of any real “Mario” elements, I cannot recommend this game enough. It’s got so much worthwhile stuff to do for the single player, and the online is shockingly good! It even got a season pass that’s absolutely worth the price! Best Mario Golf game since Toadstool Tour (might even supplant it) and may actually be a strong contender for best Mario sports game ever made if I’m being real.

**[Mario Tennis Ultra Smash](https://youtu.be/PXBWAjxioSU):** Well… it seemed like the developers used up all their creativity points on World Tour, so there’s not much to say about this one. You can’t play with your friends online, you need an Amiibo if you want to play doubles by yourself, and this game was originally full priced. Yep. At least you can grow big here?

**[Mario & Sonic Rio 2016](https://youtu.be/z8l4UR_tGeU):** See my thoughts on Sochi 2014. Also one more thing of note is that there are no Dream Events in this game. Y’know, the thing most people actually care about?

**[Mario Sports Superstars](https://youtu.be/qQZCq9hHt5Y):** Game released on 3DS only a few weeks after the Switch and Breath of the Wild launched. Who here honestly cared?

**[Mario Tennis Aces](https://youtu.be/mMHT2vdWvpg):** Actually digged this one for a good while, and the story mode was a neat distraction with plenty of cool challenges. The core tennis gameplay was exciting and deeply strategic, the online worked pretty well, and there was a good variety of courts to play on from day 1. However I largely stopped playing right after Smash came out, but at least I can say I didn’t feel my time was wasted with this one. This was the first big attempt at the “free updates” model for the Mario sports games, wherein where Nintendo would dripfeed the rest of the game’s content over the course of the year. Apparently a lot of cool stuff was added post launch, but I only really came back to it every month to get those new characters right away.

**[Mario & Sonic Tokyo 2020](https://youtu.be/TsiuwvMdXdY):** See my thoughts on Rio 2016. But at least I can see that the developers clearly had fun with this one, with the Newgrounds-esque story mode and plenty of fun references. So that’s commendable.

**[Mario Golf Super Rush](https://youtu.be/aucAzFWpvMc):** One of the biggest disappointments I’ve had with a Switch game, probably *the* biggest if I’m being frank. The golfing itself wasn’t nearly as fun as the last game, the new story mode was painful to go through, there were barely any courses at launch let alone Mario themed ones, the online was terrible, and I really was just biding my time until the next big calendar release. This one was easily the biggest offender of the “free updates” model for me, and I dropped the game long before I could take advantage of that new content. I just… I hate this game so much… I’ll go back to World Tour now.

**[Mario Strikers Battle League](https://youtu.be/cLAzzYz92r4):** I’m pretty sure most of us forgot this game existed once Xenoblade 3 and Live A Live came out nearly a month after. After 15 years of nothing we finally get a new Mario Strikers… and it’s somehow got less to offer than the two previous games combined. I will give it credit tho, it looks freaking *gorgeous* and the core soccer/football mechanics can be fun to master, but I find it’s a real clusterfuffle to keep up with what’s going on in the field. But that didn’t change the fact that there wasn’t much we could do out of the box. You can play offline and online… and that’s it. This game was also arguably worse when it came to “free updates” than Super Rush, as it only added more of the same content. Heck, Daisy wasn’t even in the game at launch! At least I can say I played this one longer than Super Rush, but I’m not returning to it anytime soon. Next Level please just bring back Punch Out, that’s all I could ask for.",Asad_Farooqui,1,13,74,985,5833,0,0
10p5sqo,The Ice Climber Conspiracy: What year did the Ice Climbers first ever appear?,"Alright, I may be going overboard with ""conspiracy"" but at the very least, there seems to be an issue out there of contradictory information to the first ever appearance of Popo and Nana. You may think this is an easy answer, but if you look online, things are a little messy. The NES version of Ice Climber was indeed released in **1985**. However, there was also an Arcade version of the game called ""Vs. Ice Climber"" supposedly first released at some point in **1984**. Let's look a bit deeper.

If you do a quick Google search of when Ice Climber was first released, it will tell you that it was first released in 1984, not 1985. This is ripped from Wikipedia, which has Ice Climber noted down as having first ever released as ""Vs. Ice Climber"" in **October 1984**. Looking around on multiple sites, you will find this same information, or in some cases, this information just completely omitted. 

That means to say that the North American Arcade version of Ice Climber was released before both the Japanese Arcade version (1985), and the Japanese NES version of Ice Climber (also 1985). Well now, that doesn't make much sense, given that Nintendo is a Japanese company and all. Is it possible they decided to release it in Arcades in North America before everywhere else? Well, looking at the release dates of every other game Nintendo released in Arcades would show that there's only one other time this ever happened: VS. Balloon Fight.

Now supposedly, VS. Balloon Fight released in North America on September 1984, and *then* released in Japan in October 1984. So, given they have done this before, it's not unlikely they did the same with Ice Climber right? Well, maybe... but where's the source of this information?

After looking for the source of this information for both VS. Ice Climber and VS. Balloon Fight, they both seem to point directly at the same Japanese book which details Arcade Game release dates. You can see them listed in this book [here](https://archive.org/details/ArcadeGameList1971-2005/page/n129/mode/2up). 

It turns out that this book has been noted for having several errors that have been verified separately in the past. Thus, it's not exactly the most trusted source on determining if both VS. Ice Climber and VS. Balloon Fight released in North America before they did in Japan.

With VS. Balloon Fight, at the very least, we know that it did indeed first release, at least in Japan, in 1984. There are Japanese ads for VS. Balloon Fight that Nintendo ran which show a Copyright Date for ""1984"", however, I cannot find a single ad for VS. Ice Climber that doesn't say ""1985"" instead, further indicating that VS. Ice Climber was not released in 1984.

And that's about where I am with looking into this topic. I tried looking on Nintendo's website, but I could only find word on the NES version, which definitely first came out in 1985 (today, January 30th, in fact). I also tried to take a look at Super Smash Bros, as I recall the All-Star mode in one of the games had you fight enemies in order of their first ever appearance. However, this turned out to be Smash for Wii U and 3DS, which unfortunately, do not feature Ice Climbers as playable characters. 

As I said, there's a lot of places online that say the arcade version was first released in 1984, so it would be great if anyone could find any further information so we can put this to rest.

(*Edit: [Someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/10p5sqo/the_ice_climber_conspiracy_what_year_did_the_ice/j6ihq4h/) pointed out that Smash Ultimate's All-Star mode also has the enemies fight in order of their first appearance, however it doesn't show exact dates, and since the two characters that Ice Climbers are inbetween are from mid 1984 to mid 1985, it doesn't help. Also of note is that the Ice Climbers trophy in SSB Melee states the Ice Climbers were first introduced in October 1985, but this is purely the NES release in North America. The PAL version of the game does not show dates whatsoever.*)",2Dement3D,1,13,77,678,4016,0,0

10plgh2,If you're still waiting on the wireless N64 controller restock - use your original N64 controller!,"Welp, it's been a year since my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/sgqp71/i_was_tired_of_waiting_for_a_wireless_n64/) and I haven't caught the wireless N64 controller in-stock on Nintendo's website yet. A ton of new N64 games have come out over the last year and I can only imagine the nostalgic N64 player base has grown substantially too. My drive to help these players play these games the way they were meant to be played along with wanting to explore new microcontrollers led me to develop a new adapter that's much cheaper and easier to make than my last!

Similar to my last adapter, once everything is programmed (much more easily this time) and the adapter is hooked up to the N64 controller. All you have to do is plug a micro USB cable into the adapter and the other end into the dock (or into a USB C adapter plugged into the Switch if you're undocked) and you're ready to go! This adapter also added mapping L + R + Start to the Home button to stop you needing to reach for a second controller.

A piece of feedback I received on my original project that stuck with me was that the setup looked too complicated. I was excited when I found a way to address this when I recently discovered the Raspberry Pi Pico - a small, $4 microcontroller that's still readily available everywhere. You can program a Raspberry Pi Pico by simply dragging and dropping a single file! The last/Arduino project required downloading and setting up several tools in order to program a couple of different chips.

What's more is that there are several features with the Pico that I haven't even worked with yet that will allow me and others to develop new features in the future (e.g. spending 2 more dollars on a Pico W would allow you to communicate with the Pico over the internet)

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback!

10qedjc,Why doesn't Nintendo remake some of their old hardware?,"This might seem stupid but hear me out.

Over the past 10 years or so we've seen a lot of emulators for their old games, mostly in the form of software emulation. But I recently learned about something called the Analogue Pocket that is essentially a spruced up Game Boy Advanced built with an FPGA (as I understand it) so you can actually use your own old dusty GB games and plug them in to play. This is a really cool project (and I don't understand really how it's legal) but it's amazed me it's taken this long for something like this to come along. Anecdotally, I don't really want to pay $300+ on eBay for a third party product like one of these, but if Nintendo had built it I'd consider it for sure. 

So it makes me wonder: why Nintendo hasn't done something like this themselves? I recall back like 7-8 years ago they remade the NES when they released the NES Classic Edition, but to my knowledge they've done nothing since. The old hardware for a lot of their handhelds and consoles has appreciated quite a bit and it makes me wonder why they haven't tried to tap into this market. 

I suspect maybe they have market research that suggests the market for ""vintage gaming"" isn't big enough to make a project like this profitable for themselves, but if it's working for Analogue why wouldn't it work for Nintendo?",PaleozoicFrogBoy,1,9,55,242,1322,0,0

 * ***Ice Climber*** was released in 1985 for the Family Computer in Japan. In this platform game, developed by *Nintendo*, it's only you and an ice hammer as you make your way to the top of the mountain! As Popo, players use a trusty mallet to work their way up a mountain. They chip away at the blocks overhead, then jump up through the resulting hole to the mountain's next level. Once Popo reaches the top level, he enters a fast-moving bonus stage in which he can pick up veggies and, hopefully, reach the summit for a big point payoff.

10nygzo,Where did Waluigi come from?,"Hey, so I recently watched a video detailing some stuff about Wario, and it got me thinking: where did Waluigi come from? In the video that I watched, the video explained that there were comics/manga where one of the explanations was just Mario and Wario were childhood friends and Wario thought Mario was a bully taking all of his fun away. But even outside of the comics, you have games like that one Yoshi’s island game where baby Wario interacts with baby Mario and such, meaning they would be interacting with each other. 
But where exactly did Waluigi come into the picture? Is there any game explanation or even comic books/manga that at least attempt to explain where he came from?",Dailey1234,1,5,28,121,689,0,0

10oxc7i,No new console for a while? Are you disappointed?,"So I heard a rumour on the internet (Shocking I know), about Nintendo starting to produce more switches in their factories. So there will be more switches coming to the stores this year. And since there is more switches being made, it probably means we won't get a new console in the next few years.

&#x200B;

Do you see that as a disappointing thing?

&#x200B;

Personally I don't care about a new console, since the switch is still kicking it and having more games available on the console is great since I feel like I'm getting my moneys worth. I've had my switch since  2017 and still use it very often.

Edit: I'm mainly asking because I've seen a lot of people whine about there not being a new console, so I was curious if this really is what majority of people think. Glad to see that a lot of people think alike and there is no huge reason to make a switch 2 anytime soon.",Gekkuri,1,9,49,166,882,0,0

 * ***Donkey Kong GB: Dinky Kong & Dixie Kong*** was released in 2000 for the Game Boy Color in Japan. In this platformer game, developed by *Rare*, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have gone missing in the Northern Kremisphere once again, and it's up to Dixie Kong and Kiddy Kong to face King K. Rool and the mad machine KAOS. This is a Japan exclusive version of *Donkey Kong Land III* with added colour but lacking some animations and dialogue.

   
   
 * ***Art Style: PiCTOBiTS*** (known as ***Art Style:PiCOPiCT*** in Europe and ***Art Style: PiCTOPiCT*** in Australia) was released in 2009 for DSiWare in Japan. In this puzzle game, developed by *skip Ltd.*, jump into the world and put your brain to the test with this colourful new game. You have blocks of six different colours, and the idea behind the game is to build up pictures of classic NES Nintendo characters. The blocks are known as PiCTOs and you can place them freely on the screen using the stylus. You have to use these PiCTOs to erase the Deca PiCTOs (groups of PiCTOs) falling from the top of the screen by combining blocks of the same colour together.

   
   
 * ***Art Style: NEMREM*** (known as ***Art Style: ZENGAGE*** in North America) was released in 2009 for DSiWare in Japan. In this puzzle game, developed by *skip Ltd.*, you have to slide the rows and columns of coloured cells (the squares) to match the colours of the cores (the beads). There are over 100 puzzles to play through with increasing difficulty and new challenges such as cells that can't be moved. The simple gameplay is accompanied by peaceful graphics and ambient sound effects, such as trickling water, to create a calm atmosphere.

   
   
 * ***Clubhouse Games Express: Card Classics*** (known as ***A Little Bit of... All-Time Classics: Card Classics*** was released in 2009 for DSiWare in Japan.

The 2010 update, which included bullet train routes, was offered for free to those who purchased the 2009 version.

   
   
 * ***Sujin Taisen: Number Battle*** (known as ***Number Battle*** in North America) was released in 2009 for DSiWare in Japan. In this puzzle/strategy game, developed by *Mitchell Corporation*, a new kind of board game combines puzzle and strategy in a battle of wits. Take turns against human or computer opponents to reach a target score, by placing numbered tiles on the board. Score points by linking the arms of each tile in various ways: tiles with the same number or sequence of numbers, and tiles in a loop. Also look out for special squares that affect play in new ways.

   
   
 * ***Photo Clock*** was released in 2009 for DSiWare in Japan. In this utility, developed by *Nintendo*, a clock displays photos taken with the Nintendo DSi Camera in the background. Select between analogue and digital displays, 12 and 24 hours and change the time without changing the time set to the Nintendo DSi. You can also set an alarm function.

   
   
 * ***2-in-1 Solitaire*** (known as ***Touch Solitaire*** in North America) was released in 2009 for DSiWare in Japan. In this classic game, developed by *Nintendo*, in Spider, the aim is to stack cards in full suits so they are cleared from the game. Any top card can be moved, however, sequences of cards in a suit can be moved together. When no plays can be made, more cards are dealt. In Klondike, the aim is to place all 52 cards into the Foundations, built up by suit from Ace to King. Until cards can be moved to the Foundations, they must be stacked from high to low in alternating colours.

   
   
 * ***Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation*** (known as ***Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie*** in PAL territories) was released in 2010 for the Nintendo DS in Japan. In this role-playing game, developed by *ArtePiazza*, it's the final encounter... you and two comrades make your way through the deep forest and ride swiftly astride a great dragon to the keep of a fiend named Murdaw. As you traverse the lonely corridors, a sense of unease settles over your party, and it's not long before you reach the throne room and an epic encounter begins...

10ngd13,The Surprisingly Small World of Nintendo Compilation Games,"Like any long-standing game company, Nintendo is no stranger to celebrating their franchises with compilations. They’ve been compiling games ever since the PlayChoice-10 arcade cabinets (which were way before my time) to as recently as Nintendo Switch Online. But while other Japanese publishers like Capcom and Konami have had a more consistent track record with their game compilations, Nintendo has a noticeably spottier reputation when you consider their output. They vary wildly in quality, but I’m gonna talk about a few compilations out there that I own (along with one that I don’t), one per game franchise:

**[Super Mario All Stars](https://youtu.be/OGW4wrVTdow):** This was released for the Super Nintendo in 1993 and brought us 16-bit remasters of Super Mario Bros 1, 2, 3, and Lost Levels AKA the original Super Mario Bros 2. Along with the new visuals came remastered music and new jumping physics, some of which caught me off guard when I first played it. I was used to the more generous physics of newer 2D Mario games, so seeing Mario lose momentum when hitting blocks definitely raised an eyebrow and led to me getting hit every once in a while. I own the Wii version with none of the physical extras, which is apparently just the old SNES ROM burned onto a Wii disc with no new changes or additions. Very underwhelming, especially compared to what’s coming up.

**[The Legend of Zelda Collector’s Edition](https://youtu.be/q0nkWYcJF30):** This was a special set available in the early 2000s as a preorder bonus for the then-upcoming Wind Waker, as well as to subscribers of Nintendo Power magazine some time later. This bundle includes Zelda 1, Zelda 2, Ocarina of Time and Majora’s Mask, along with a demo disc for Wind Waker and a retrospective video on the series up to that point. As someone who did not grow up with a GameCube, I had to rely on secondhand accounts on the collection’s quality. And based on what I’ve seen across the interwebs, the emulation of Majora’s Mask in particular was quite problematic. But the collection did include the first ever official release of Master Quest for Ocarina, so that’s something.

**[Metroid Prime Trilogy](https://youtu.be/u8klx34R8m8):** It’s hard to believe that there was a time where we doubted an unknown American studio would be able to recapture what made the 2D Metroid games so special. Yet here we are with one of the strongest video game trilogies of the 21st century and fans begging for more. This immaculate 2009 collection brings together enhanced Wii ports of Metroid Prime 1 and 2 along with the third game and a multiplayer mode into one dual-layered disc. The first two games were re-outfitted with Prime 3’s Wii controls, and they play beautifully with the remote in my opinion. It’s so seamless to just point at whatever problems needed shooting, and you don’t even have to think about it. However these new controls are mandatory, as you can’t revert to a more traditional controller if you want to play that way. The credits system (basically an achievement system you can redeem for extra goodies) was also applied to the first two games, but some credits are unusable nowadays given that they previously relied on the Wii’s online services to operate. This collection is available digitally on the Wii U eShop if you don’t wanna pay a premium, but that’s going away in less than 2 months so act fast.

**[Kirby’s Dream Collection](https://youtu.be/nA6cqE5gDIs):** This might just be Nintendo’s magnum opus when it comes to game compilations. Released for the Wii in 2012 as the final first party Nintendo game for the system, HAL Labs pulled out all the stops to celebrate the pink puffball’s 20th anniversary. Right from the outset, you can jump into six Kirby games ranging from the original Dream Land to Kirby 64, which play about exactly as you remember them. But the best thing about this package in my opinion are the extras. There’s an entire set of new exclusive challenge stages based on Kirby’s Return to Dream Land, one of which allows you to play with the Smash copy ability! In addition the museum mode features an interactive timeline with cute bits of real world trivia, scans of box sets to mess around with, gameplay videos of games not featured in the collection and, most shocking of all, three full length episodes of the Kirby Right Back At Ya anime series. It’s a wonderful tribute to the franchise, and I suppose my only real gripe is that it never released in Europe or Australia for some reason.

 * ***Yoshi Touch & Go*** was released in 2005 for the Nintendo DS in Japan. In this platforming game, developed by *Nintendo EAD Group No. 4*, steady your stylus hand and get ready to help Yoshi come to the rescue of Baby Mario in the unique action game Yoshi Touch & Go. As Yoshi carries Baby Mario through  perilous side-scrolling levels, use the stylus to throw eggs at enemies, lead him to fruit, and jump over dangers. In vertical scrolling levels, draw clouds to encircle enemies and lead Baby Mario to safety through the skies.

   
   
 * ***Flametail*** (known as ***Trailblaze: Puzzle Incinerator*** in Europe) was released in 2009 for DSiWare in Japan. In this action/puzzle game, developed by *Mindware*, blaze a path across the galaxy. Holding the Nintendo DSi vertically, you must plot a route for your Flametail pod, using its red hot exhaust ports to burn through obstacles on your way to the next planet. Manoeuvre around a maze of blocks to burn them away as your pod passes by to clear the stage. Fortunately, there are plentiful power-ups and items such as the Bomb to blast a wide radius.

10lqkaj,"Are there any Wii U games which used the dual-screen functionality well, in your opinion?","I think most people who have owned a Wii U would agree that most games didn't do a lot with the Gamepad. Some Wii U games didn't require the Gamepad at all and could be played entirely with a Pro Controller (although that may be a good thing if you love the Pro Controller).

But, I do think there were some games that used the dual-screen functionality well:

Nintendo Land - this launch title definitely has my favourite uses of the Gamepad. Minigames like Mario Chase, Luigi's Ghost Mansion, Pikmin Adventure, Yoshi's Fruit Cart and Takamaru's Ninja Castle would be difficult or even impossible to port to the Switch. Luigi's Ghost Mansion had the most creative use of it, with one player being a ghost and invisible to the other players on the TV. It makes for a very fun minigame where the ghost can surprise the other players due to the lack of screen cheating.

Pikmin 3 - I haven't played the Switch port of this game, but I think this game made good use of the Gamepad. You could use a Wii Remote to aim and throw Pikmin, while using the Gamepad to get an overhead view of the map and direct captains with the touchscreen. I think the Gamepad was implemented smoothly without being too gimmicky.

Xenoblade Chronicles X - This is one of many games that uses the Gamepad for a map, but there is a bit more to it. You can use the Gamepad to place mining probes which earn you money and resources as you play the game, and you can use the probes as fast travel points.

Super Mario Maker - Definitely the best use of the Gamepad for a single player game. It still works fine on the Switch, but I definitely prefer the Gamepad for making levels.

Hyrule Warriors - the singleplayer barely uses the Gamepad, but it is pretty useful for multiplayer. One player uses the TV while the other uses the Gamepad, so there's need to split the screen in half.

DS Virtual Console - the Wii U is the only official way to play DS games on a TV, and it accurately replicates the two screens of the DS. Games like Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks, and the Pokemon Ranger games feel very suited for the Wii U. It would be very hard to make these games work on Switch. Once the eShop shuts down in March, these games may be sadly lost forever.",pokeweeb3,1,15,89,415,2232,0,0

I'm seeing a fair bit of people who are just now learning about Goldeneye on Switch, which is coming on January 27th. From these new people, I'm seeing a lot of confusion about what it is and how it works, so I have compiled some information for those people who are hoping to play it.

# Goldeneye on Switch is an N64 game as **part of the NSO Expansion Pack**. 

* It is not a standalone game. **You cannot buy it separately.** 
* You cannot buy the Expansion Pack separately from a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. You have to buy a Nintendo Switch Online subscription **and** buy a Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack subscription to play Goldeneye or any other N64 games.

# Its online play is not different from any other N64 game in the pack. 

* You can not play with random people, only people on your friends list.
* Each player will be able to see each other's screen.
* It will not have Crossplay with the Xbox release of Goldeneye that was also announced. *(By the way, the Xbox port of Goldeneye that was announced has local multiplayer only with no online features at all)*

You will only be able to play **split screen** multiplayer with **people on your friends list**, exactly the same as it would have looked on an actual N64. There will be no special features or Crossplay with any other systems. It will require the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack to play, and it will be an **emulated N64 game**.",razorbeamz,1,12,60,286,1590,0,0

10li872,PSA: For those wanting second stick controls in Goldeneye this weekend,"This may not be an issue, as there may be an added setting in to add second stick controls that just wasn't mentioned in the trailer, but what you can do to fix the issue if it's there is go to your remap menu in switch and remap dpad to right stick then save those controls as Goldeneye, then in Goldeneye go to the watch menu and select Solitaire or 1.4 and you should be good to go. It's  not perfect but for those used to modern control schemes it works just fine. If the remaster from 2007 rom or the remaster of perfect dark are anything to go by I would hope this wouldn't be an issue as it seems they would have gone in and touched up controls as well but you never know. Hope this helps some enjoy the game better as I know older control schemes can get frustrating to get used to, while some find them comforting and that's why options are always great! ^_^ Positive energy everyone's way and stay gold(eneye)!",Jmann8907,1,11,70,177,920,0,0

10lsg54,"Looking back, why did so many Nintendo fans hate the Wii so much?","Because I’m absolutely loving it now! When compared alongside the other consoles in Nintendo’s lineup, I’ve noticed a lot of fans tend to gravitate towards the GameCube. And I can understand why; its library is filled with so many one-of-a-kind experiences, many of which haven’t really been replicated in subsequent console efforts. But there was a reason why it came in dead last during that console generation, right? Despite its strong library in retrospect, the PS2 and Xbox crushed it and that’s just a plain fact. If you’re gonna treat the GameCube’s lineup with this much relish and nostalgia, why aren’t people doing the same for the Wii? I mean isn’t that the true mark of a good console’s worth?

The narrative around the Wii these days is that it was a gimmicky casualtastic shovelware sonata. And after watching something like Nintendo’s infamous E3 2008 press conference, I can definitely see why many would think that. But obviously, I wholeheartedly disagree. The Wii gave us so many quality first party games that people tend to dismiss when generalizing the console’s legacy like this. We got the Mario Galaxy games, two new Zeldas, a bunch of Kirby games, awesome Mario Kart and Smash entries, the Virtual Console, the New Play Control line which gave us excellent ports of Pikmin 1 and 2, revivals of dormant franchises like Wario Land and DKC, and Nintendo actually gave a shit about Metroid that generation! Heck the Wii was the console that gave us Xenoblade Chronicles, for crying out loud. Oh and about the whole “shovelware” thing? News flash: every successful console had shovelware. The PS2 had it, the PS4 had it, and even the Switch has it; just take one cursory glance at the “coming soon” section on the Nintendo Switch eShop.

And yes third parties didn’t sleep on the Wii either; the quality stuff was always there, you just had to search for them. We got excellent ports of Resident Evil 4 and Okami, a hidden gem of a fighting game in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom, an actually great Sonic game in Sonic Colors, an exhilarating sword combat game in Red Steel 2, revivals of Klonoa, Samba De Amigo, A Boy and His Blob, NiGHTS and more! Over the past several months give or take, I’ve been digging deeper and deeper into the treasure trove of quality exclusives that the Wii had in store. At this point in time I’ve acquired over a dozen Wii titles physically from both first and third party publishers, plus a few others through the Wii U eShop. [Here’s my current stack of physical games so far for those curious](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/799008375131340860/1066155879877066793/IMG_5655.jpg). And now I’m just gonna go through a couple of the ones I own and have put a decent amount of time into:

**Punch Out Wii:** A phenomenal reboot that beautifully translates what made the NES game so special into the modern age. The arcade-style gameplay and gorgeous cartoony animations are amazing to behold. It’s a tough game to master, but boy is it ever addictive to watch my opponent finally go down every single time. This might just be my favorite game on the entire console, and I’m itching to go back and clear more of the extra challenges the game has to offer.

**Zack & Wiki:** A delightful point and click puzzle adventure game and a brand new IP from Capcom of all things. The Wii controls are used to great effect here and it even went on to win several awards when it first came out. It’s a damn shame we never got more out of this IP; I would’ve loved to see where Capcom would’ve went with it given the advancements in motion control since 2007. At least it got acknowledged in that one Wii golf game Capcom also published, which I also own.

**MadWorld:** You may have heard of a little company called PlatinumGames. Y’know, the folks who made Bayonetta, Astral Chain, and Metal Gear Rising? Well this was where they made their debut and what a way to make a name for oneself. This was a gory, over-the-top beatemup depicted in a striking black and white artstyle, akin to the graphic novel Sin City. The ways you can impale a dude to a wall or saw their arms off are ridiculous, and the boss fights ramp things up in typical Platinum fashion. If nothing else the soundtrack is an absolute bop if you’ve got an ear for hip hop, so give it a listen when you’ve got the free time!

**The Last Story:** If you know about Xenoblade, chances are you’ve least heard about The Last Story to some degree. This was one of three big JRPGs that avid fans famously campaigned for a North American localization, alongside Xenoblade and Pandora’s Tower (which I also own in the latter’s case), but this one shouldn’t be slept on if you consider yourself a fan of the genre. It’s an action RPG produced by Mistwalker, the studio created by Final Fantasy’s original creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, and with music done by legendary Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu. They previously worked together on the Xbox 360 exclusives Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey, and this stands right alongside them as some of their finest work. Characters are grounded and endearing with wonderful British voice acting, the real time combat system is tactical and never gets boring, and the soundtrack is sublime as expected of Uematsu. And it all wraps up in about 20-25 hours or so, making it a fantastic fit for more time-conscious RPG players who just can’t get down with playtimes the length of Xenoblade or Persona these days.",Asad_Farooqui,1,13,65,943,5446,0,0

10kjpcn,Ideas for Luigi's Mansion 4??,"Hey everyone, just a huge Luigi's Mansion nerd here.

I remember back in the day after Luigi's Mansion 2, there was all this buzz on this sub about what the setting could be for a, at the time, hypothetical Luigi's Mansion 3.

Shockingly enough, I remember a lot of people being exactly right with the idea of a haunted hotel!  I had never even thought of that concept but when they said it, it was so perfect and I couldn't see it going ANY other way.  Of course, Luigi's Mansion 3 has been out now for a few years and some youtubers (Arlo) are musing on the idea of a Luigi's Mansion 4.  Does anyone else have any ideas on what the new haunted location could be?

[I saw one idea for a haunted cruise ship in a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJTPbZeEgbk) by Nin10doland, which would be amazing.  Maybe going back to the roots to an even bigger mega grande mansion like the first? Haunted Peach's Castle? Maybe a haunted resort on Isle Delfino?!

And where could they go with plot?  Is it getting stale to have characters stuck in portraits?  We know Mario has to be unavailable for SOME reason because otherwise Luigi wouldn't be forced to be the hero again.  Im completely drawing a blank on that though...

So yeah, just a discussion I thought might be fun for other Luigi's Mansion fans out there. :)",PressYtoHonk,1,5,29,235,1313,0,0
10ktlos,On This Day in Nintendo History: Picross DS,"#On this day (January 25) in Nintendo history...

   
   
 * ***Picross DS*** was released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS in Japan. In this puzzle game, developed by *Jupiter*, the word Picross is a combination of ""picture"" and ""crossword puzzle"". Each Picross puzzle consists of a grid whose cells need to be filled with squares and crosses. By doing this correctly, you essentially 'paint' a picture. There are numbers at the head of the grid's columns and rows which signify how the grid needs to be filled out, but it will take a sharp mind to figure out the solution.

 * ***Balloon Fight*** was released in 1985 for the Family Computer in Japan. In this action game, developed by *Nintendo*, you'll need lightning-fast reactions to win this battle in the sky! Manoeuvring an airborne character to pop your opponents' balloons before they pop yours sounds easy, but don't be fooled by this game's simple premise or cute visuals. Underneath these elements you'll discover a surprisingly challenging game with strategy to spare.

   
   
 * ***Hotel Dusk: Room 215*** was released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS in North America. In this point-and-click adventure, developed by *Cing*, players take the role of Kyle Hyde, an ex-cop turned salesman trying to track down a missing friend. Clues lead to an eerie, old hotel rumoured to have one very strange room - a room where wishes are granted. Players check in and get ready for a night of surprises as they meet a cast of unusual characters and try to unravel the mystery.

   
   
 * A third wave of ***Super Smash Bros. amiibo Figures*** was released in **2015** in Japan and included *Rosalina*; *Bowser*; *Lucario*; *Toon Link*; *Sheik*; *Ike*; *King Dedede* and *Meta Knight*.

10jcalk,the unloved character (Waluigi),"
Waluigi's (derived from the Japanese word 'warui' meaning evil, compounded with 'Luigi'; thus Waluigi means something like ""evil Luigi"") first appearance was in 'Mario Tennis' for Nintendo 64 which was designed by a company called ""Camelot"". So Nintendo did not work at all at this game. The only reason Camelot created Waluigi for this game was, that they needed a second character who can play together with Wario in a team. So this means that Waluigi is the first and only Super Mario ""main-character"" who was neither invented nor designed by Nintendo themselves which could be the reason why he so often does not appear in the ""main-line"" Mario games and it seems that Nintendo has no love at all for this poor guy.

Since 'Mario Tennis' Waluigi is just existing for the reason he was originally  intvented: for being a stopgap in various spin-off-mario games. For example his first appearance in a Mario Kart game was in 'Mario Kart Double Dash' (they once more just needed a character who plays together with Wario). Since then, he's been part of the character roster of neatly every Mario Kart, except for 'Mario Kart 7'. Which is funny because they even added a playable ""Waluigi's Pinball"" remake to the game but not Waluigi himself. They kicked him out to make space for Wiggler and Honey Queen, which is kind of bizarre in my opinion.

but it feels like this is just the top of the iceberg:

Even if it seems like Waluigi is an important character in the Mario-World-lore at a first glance, this is just be true for the spin-off games but not for the ""main-line-games"" since hes not even allowed to be anywhere near to such a game. The reason behind this, in my opinion, cant only be fact that he was invented as a stopgap. Toadette for example in the first way was created as a stopgap too. The only reason to add her was that Toad needed a driving partner in 'Mario Kart Double Dash'. But she still made it into the ""main-line"" game 'New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe' as a playable character. In 'Mario 64 DS' there are also different playable characters avaible. Such as Mario, Luigi, Wario and ..
Yoshi (?). Even if that would have been the perfect steep template for introducing Waluigi into the ""main-line-games"" they decided to not implement him. In the Mario Version of Monopoly the ""Waluigi-field"" is the most cheap one. In 'Fortune Street' Bowser even says something like ""nobody likes you"" to Waluigi, which makes me kind of sad for him.

fun fact: not even Luigi (the character who is known for being always scared by everything) does not take Waluigi for full bc he says ""Luigi not afraid"" when at their first encounter back then.",m_mustermensch,1,4,31,467,2653,0,0

 * ***Ice Hockey*** was released in 1988 for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan. In this sports game, developed by *Nintendo EAD* with *Pax Softnica*, sharpen your skates and skills, and shoot your way to victory! Ice Hockey is a hard hitting, fast-action competitive sport. And this game recreates all of the excitement, from face-offs to penalty shots. Pick your team's formations by selecting the features of your players, and get ready for face-off!

   
   
 * ***Fire Emblem: Monshō no Nazo*** was released in 1994 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this tactical role-playing game, developed by *Intelligent Systems*, long ago, the Falchion Sword and the Fire Emblem were forged and passed to Anri to destroy Medeus, leader of the Mamcoot race. Many generations have passed, and war has broken out over a plot to revive Medeus. Marth of Altea escapes his kingdom and must now restore the Fire Emblem to bring an end to Medeus.

   
   
 * ***Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3*** was released in 1994 for the Game Boy in Japan. In this platforming game, developed by *Nintendo R&D1*, be the bad guy and explore the many exciting levels of Kitchen Island. Things are really cookin' on Kitchen Island. Wario has heard that the pirates have a giant golden statue of Princess Toadstool. After being kicked out of the last castle by his rival, Mario, he's scheming to steal the statue. Help Wario collect treasure by smashing into objects and foes.

   
   
 * ***Super Smash Bros.*** was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64 in Japan. In this fighting game, developed by *HAL Laboratory*, can Link beat up Mario? Can Yoshi deck Donkey Kong? Can Kirby punch out Pikachu?These and other age-old questions are answered with *Super Smash Bros.*, the original all-star Nintendo tournament fighter for Nintendo 64. Crossing multiple universes and alternate dimensions, the most popular of Nintendo's characters grace this bare-knuckle Pak.

   
   
 * ***Tomato Adventure*** was released in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance in Japan. In this role-playing game, developed by *AlphaDream*, the Ketchup Kingdom is a land run by children who love tomatoes. Children who don't like tomatoes are banished to Kobora Village until they learn to like them. DeMille and his girlfriend Pasaran are among the banished. On Tomato Day, King Abira of the Tomato Kingdom unveils the Super Cara-Cooker, a weapon that transforms people into toys. He kidnaps Pasaran for her Heart Energy.

   
   
   
 * ***Advance Wars: Days of Ruin*** (known in PAL territories as ***Advance Wars: Dark Conflict***) was released in 2008 for the Nintendo DS in North America. In this turn-based tactics game, developed by *Intelligent Systems*, in a new twist to the Advance Wars franchise, your Commanding Officer (CO) can now be a direct part of the battle. Being a capable strategist in the war room is one thing, but being an admired warrior on the battlefield - that's the true test of a commander.

I own New Leaf (the best one apparently), but I don’t want to have to manipulate my system clock for reasons other than daylight savings time, despite the fact that it’s generally expected for players at this point. And this is on top of the fact that I’m not all that interested in life sims as a genre. The closest I ever got to that point was Stardew Valley, but even then I bounced off hard once real life started getting in the way.

On a related note: I’m also somewhat reluctant to try out Splatoon these days for a different reason: the timing was wrong for me this time. Splatoon 1 was a game I played the crap out of back in 2015 and 2016. Same with Splatoon 2.

We’re coming back to that era - **flip** phones. Samsung is leading the way with other manufacturers rumored to be releasing some in the coming years. 

What else is coming? **AR**. It’s been here but Apple is close to bringing it to the masses. And Nintendo had us playing AR cards games and other games with the 3DS and its external cameras.

10hp9zm,Switch's successor might not coming soon.,"So this is the thing: according to Bloomberg's reports, Nintendo is increasing the production of Switches, implying that they're still going to sell it for a really long time, so Switch's successor is NOT coming next year like we thought. 

At this point, I think we can even expect the next 3d Mario game and Metroid Prime 4 coming to Switch itself. Admittedly thought, this really confuses me: I was really convinced that Nintendo was going to release the next console next year, using the two games I mentioned as launch year titles. Plus, Switch already sold 120 millions of units, making it the third best selling console ever (after PS2 and DS, althought I don't think it will manage to reach them, they sold 155 millions at their time) I don't know how many console they really expect to still sell at this point. Plus from the last months of 2021 to the end of 2023, Nintendo will have released one mainline game for most or its major IPs, and 2023 itself seems that is gonna be poor with just three major titles (Fire Emblem Engage, Zelda Tears of the Kingdom and Pikmin 4), four it we consider the remake of Kirby's Return to Dreamland. Exvluding Pokemon, it takes 3 or 4 years for a new entry of their IPs to release after the previous one, and unless they plan to revive dormant IPs like F-Zero or Punch Out, I don't see any imminent announcement for the next future aside Mario and Metroid Prime.

So this is what I wonder: is Nintendo still going to rely on Switch that much in 2024, relying on just the next Mario game and Metroid Prime 4? And if its successor will release in 2025 instead, on which games will it supposed to rely on in its launch year?",MegaManTheMighty,1,6,41,306,1668,0,0

Third party developers always target the absolute limit of any console. So new games on a potential ""Switch Pro"" or ""Switch 2"" will actually run equally as well as games run on the current Switch, because developers will just target the absolute peak of what that system can put out the same way they do on the current systems.

Sure, they may be shinier with higher resolutions and features like raytracing, but they won't actually run better, especially since most developers prefer to target resolution over targeting framerate.",razorbeamz,1,32,190,119,707,0,0

Mario Kart Wii was unforgiving. You lost your weapons if you crashed. Unlocking characters was a chore. The online play was brutally competitive. 

Given how long Nintendo has invested in Mario Kart 8, I feel like Mario Kart Wii is a distant memory for most, and a completely foreign game to many who never had a Wii. 

Can Nintendo ever move on from Mario Kart 8? Thoughts?",SteakJones,1,6,25,107,586,0,0
10g7fso,My idea for an Nintendo smartphone and smartwatch that would be pretty darn cool,"So I'm going to start off with describing the smartphone. This device would be designed to stand out from other smartphones on the market. It would do this by offering features and functionality to take advantage of the Nintendo brand. It would run on Android with a custom skin that gives it a distinct walk and feel along with pre-installed Nintendo apps such as a fitness app with me, characters and the ability to connect with friends and family for fitness challenges and maybe some mobile games.

The phone would have the typical smartphone specs that are typical like a good camera processor screen resolution and stuff like that. The phone would also have the ability to use amiibo figures in some of their mobile games and everything

Now for some of the apps like the clock app, it would have a unique design with the clear and easy to read in her face that displays the current time and date in it. The app would also have a variety of different clock faces Jews from including some that are themed around popular Nintendo characters and franchises. The alarms would also be integrated with the fitness app and your watch. You can also get those clock faces for the app onto your watch as well, but it would allow you to set alarms that are tied to their fitness goals such as waking up early to go for a morning run or to do some stretching before they go to bed.

The same thing goes for the calendar and weather app etc. It could have some design that uses some Nintendo characters in it's  design.

Now one of the cool features of this phone is the ability to set me characters using the camera or creating them yourself with the messaging app which could just be Google's messaging app or creating their own custom but messaging app on the phone. But you want to be able to set your contacts with me characters or a variety of custom profile pictures similar to the Nintendo switch.

Now on to the smartwatch it would be a device that is specifically designed to work with the phone though They can have it work with any phone. They probably would go with the route of having it be exclusive to their phone It would obviously can modern design that feels like Nintendo. It would have the common things like a color touch display that would show the time and could also show other functionality on the watch faces such as fitness and health metrics such as steps taken, calories burned and distance traveled. The watch would also have a built-in heart rate monitor like other smart watches which would allow for more accurate tracking of physical activity It would also have other built-in features like the ability to pay for goods and services with the watch. Like most other watches, it would have the essential features that both smart watches have

Now some key features of the smartwatch would be the ability to connect with the built-in fitness app on the phone. Users will be able to set fitness goals, tractor progress and compare their results with friends and family who have the watch watch, but also have the ability to connect to the Nintendo switch or future consoles with games like Nintendo switch sports or ring fit adventure, allowing users to track their progress in those games and having those specific games show up in their fitness tracking app and how many calories they burned while playing those games, as well as allowing you to earn rewards for reaching certain goals in those games

Nintendo could also have a variety of custom watch faces using certain Nintendo characters and everything that would be available for the watch, one of which would have your me character on the screen that you can tap on and get in more in-depth look at your health and everything. They can also include a variety of different watch bands have a Nintendo feel such as a watch band that has a Pikachu pattern, a Kirby pattern, or a Mario pattern

I think the concept of having a Nintendo phone and a smartwatch would be really cool and could be beneficial to Nintendo because they could incorporate some features that would be unique between their phones and their consoles together. Like I mentioned for the smartwatch, having the ability to connect with fitness games would be pretty cool and everything. I also think Nintendo getting into these markets. Yes, there's a lot of different companies already in this market, but I think Nintendo could make it difference by incorporating elements of their consoles UI design and Android 13 to come up with the coolest type of phone. I like to see what your guys's thoughts are and what other ideas that you guys have for this idea and if you like this idea",Drawesome045,1,14,80,824,4631,0,0

10csmac,I found a strange developer message In a shovelware DS game...," now, a few weeks ago, I was kinna bored so I decided to go on amazon and buy one of those crappy 500-in-one combo carriages. You know, for the heck of it. So it comes, and I don't play it for a while. (my 2ds charger broke) So I pick it up a few weeks later, and it was basically your average combo-cart deal. A few great, but glitchy games, shovelware, shovelware, shovelware, lots of shovelware. So I decided to pick a random game and hope for the best. (the combo cart was buggy as hell so the text for the games wasn't showing) so I click on some random game to which some strange logo appears in the background and text starts scrolling. The first time I saw it, I wasn't actually sure what is said but as I read it a few more times I realised what this was. A dev message, and a good one at that. In the text, the dev downright insults the game calling it ""a bucket of shovelware"" and starts to talk about a bunch of random stuff like other devs, personal messages and a bunch of over stuff. The text then ends with ""see you in the next release"" and the game starts up. And guess what this particular game is called? some kid's game Paws and claws: regal resort. Wow. So either they had no game testers and the management didn't bother to check the game, or being put on a combo cart messed up the game a lot. I looked around on the internet a bit and couldn't find find any documentation on this, so I thought I'd post my findings to the subreddit. If you stumble upon a legitimate copy of this game and had a similar/different experience please let me know. Once again, the game's called paws and claws regal resort if you wanna try it out. I'm also curious on weather this happened on the sequels to this titles, as there are many. Thanks for reading this, by the way. I appreciate it. :)",superspeedbro9,1,11,62,347,1798,0,0
10cvq2i,I have experienced the best customer support experience anyone could wish for,"So for context, I had a Link Between Worlds 3DS, purchased around 2014, but it was stolen by the end of 2015.

So now that the eshop is closing, I wanted to get a new one, maybe recoup my old account and get everything I wanted, mainly Pokémon and Zelda games for the 3DS.

So I looked for a month, to find a locked 3DS in good condition, but was unable to, in my area. I ended up buying a brand new one. I tried linking my old account, but wasn't able to, it was already linked to another 3DS, so I ended up creating a new one, and because I needed to test the 3DS and because I'm super impatient, I bought X, UM and Crystal on it.

Meanwhile, I sent an e-mail to customer support trying to get the old account back. It was a back and forth of about 4 e-mails, they asked a bunch of information about my old NNID, my old 3DS and my new one. Also means of contact, and preferred times to receive a call.

After that it went silent for a while, I was expecting the call, but the week went by, and nothing. Come friday 13th, I receive a call, the agent said that the request was sitting there because there was another account linked to the 3DS system I informed them about, and they wanted to check if it was mine. I told them it was, explained the situation, and then they told me they were proceeding with the request, the system transfer for my old account, and they asked if I wished to merge the two accounts together.

I didn't even know that was a possibility, I said yes, and they told me I would get an e-mail with further instructions.

That was the end of it, by friday's night I was logged into my old NNID, and downloading a bunch of games I didn't even know I had. Though I couldn't find the 3 purchased on my new NNID though, so I e-mailed them back, because I had not gotten any news from them. Turns out they were on another tab on the redownload page. Sadly, I was missing UM. I think they added the update, instead of the game, I don't know if it was a glitch in the system or a misclick by the operator.

So I e-mailed them again, and just now, they added UM to my account.

So, TL;DR, I got my old account back which I assumed was lost, and even the games I spent on a second account I got to add to the original, so I wouldn't lose any money spent. And this was done over two weekends, with quick replies even during sundays.

10boh6v,The Wide World of Batshit Crazy Nintendo Crossover Games,"Crossovers can be a beautiful thing. They can also feel like the drunken ramblings of a madman come to life by some stroke of fate. And I don’t just mean things like Smash Bros, Mario & Sonic, or Mario + Rabbids; everyone knows about those by now. There are some crossovers out there, some quite recent, that you wouldn’t imagine in your wildest dreams. I’m gonna talk about four of them here, and these are not just simple guest appearances in games that can otherwise do without them:

**[Mario X Puzzles & Dragons](https://youtu.be/OkDxCwg0U4Q):** P&D is an incredibly popular mobile puzzle game in Japan, and it got a crossover with Mario in 2015 for the 3DS. It’s a mix of a three-match puzzle game and a monster collecting RPG, and in the Mario version the monsters you collect are Mario baddies, like a Koopa riding a Cheep Cheep. I’m not a big puzzle guy myself, but I do enjoy Dr. Mario from time to time. This series is still going on the Switch today, but they haven’t taken a stab at another Mario collaboration since. It’s pretty cheap on the eShop!

**[Zelda X Crypt of the NecroDancer](https://youtu.be/oYd_pph6RnI):** Crypt was a rhythm-based roguelike that originally came out in the mid-2010s, with music done by the composer for Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac. One morning in 2019 during the Nindies Direct that also announced Cuphead for Switch, Nintendo and developer Brace Yourself Games drunkenly stumbled in and announced their lovechild, Cadence of Hyrule, a sequel to Crypt that would be a collaboration with Zelda. It was released in June with a DLC season pass coming the following year.

**[Pokemon X Nobunaga’s Ambition](https://youtu.be/SaG5c-hZNBU):** Let’s take one of the most accessible RPG series around and combine it with one of the most complicated genres in gaming. Pokemon Conquest was announced and quietly released in 2012 for the DS, a whole year after the 3DS was out. This combined the vast roster, type matching, and evolutions of the core Pokemon games with the grid based map of a tactical RPG and set it in a region inspired by feudal Japan. And the story actually treats Arceus with more gravitas and respect than anything else up to that point! This was a key player in Nintendo and Koei Tecmo’s relationship, as it would eventually lead to the Nintendo Warriors games and KT’s involvement for Fire Emblem Three Houses.

**[Fire Emblem X Shin Megami Tensei](https://youtu.be/L_gYQCOlW9E):** So uh funny story. Atlus originally pitched this idea as a crossover between Fire Emblem and Pokemon, but the aforementioned Pokemon Conquest was already in production at that time. So a crossover with SMT it was then. Atlus was given free reign to create an RPG they never had before, so wave goodbye to the demons and phallic monsters of the SMT series and say hello to the bubbly pop idols and bright colors of contemporary Tokyo! This would give the game its namesake: Tokyo Mirage Sessions. Gameplay relies on the traditional “press turn” system of previous MegaTen titles, only now with combo extenders called Session attacks and Fire Emblem’s weapon triangle. Also your party members wield FE characters as JoJo stands, and Marth goes Super Saiyan and sings in Japanese at one point.",Asad_Farooqui,1,9,56,544,3242,0,0

10bh1kz,Possibility of more Nintendo Movies?,"My never grew up with Nintendo games, however I did play 2 of them with a friend who did have one. Smash bros. Ultimate and Mario kart Wii. With this new super Mario movie im ecstatic to see. And I really hope it does very well. 

I may be the only one probably and I might be crazy for thinking this, but with this movie coming out this year I wonder if we will get more Nintendo license franchise movies in the future. 

Possible future Nintendo movies:

Metroid

Star Fox

The Legend of Zelda

Super Smash Bros.

Animal crossing

I can see a possibility of Zelda being most likely to a future fantasy action/adventure style movie. There is a chance with not only movies but a full on Nintendo IP series on TV or Streaming services. 

I would say Animal crossing would be a perfect And great choice to be a comedy series similar to the office but focused on the town a people more oriented to kids and families

It would moat likely be an CG animated Pixar style-ish(most likely Illumination) Series and I Think the voice actors for the characters

I could be wrong and we might have another one like as it could be considered by some people another movie adaptation of a video game I.e. Uncharted, last of us series on HBO max, tomb raider movies Angelina Jolie played Laura in. This Mario movie i know for a fact will and has great potential. Im not a big fan of Illumination cause the ""minions"" are overrated in a way but they are still the best talented animation studio for a mario movie. I just Hope with this we will get to see more Nintendo movies; not just Zelda, star fox, and metroid, but also fire emblem smash bros, and Kirby. 

Once the Mario movie makes record box office sales i bet we'll see this as a push for others companies to do the same

Disney can easily EASILY make a Kingdom hearts movie or series on Disney+. And maybe just maybe... A series adaptation of GTA San Andreas?


This is a possibility thia may actually happen in the future or near future if thia movie does beyond well.

108mdd6,"We’re most likely getting a Pokemon spinoff or two in 2023, so I wanna ask what spinoffs do you personally want to see?","Some quick background as to where I stand on Pokemon spinoffs. I’ve never been one to dive into the mainline games, and frankly I believe I’m better off for that given TPC’s recent business practices. So it was to the spinoffs where I would seek my Pokemon fix and I think I’ve gotten a few bangers under my belt.

My first real foray into the world of Pokemon spinoffs was the Pokemon TCG game for Game Boy Color. It’s basically like the core games, but with deckbuilding and a crapton more RNG to contend with. Thankfully since I was playing this via the 3DS Virtual Console, I could save scum until I got the results I wanted. And while I have yall here, you got less than 3 months to buy this game before the 3DS eShop shuts down, so if you’re interested at all then go add some funds and get on that.

My second (and only other) spinoff experience was New Pokemon Snap for the Switch. This was apparently something that fans have been wanting now for over 20 years, and based on the reception it appears to have delivered on that front. More Pokemon, more replayability, more online features, and even more content via a random post-launch update a few months later. Not much else to say other than it’s more Pokemon Snap. I played using gyro controls because gyro aiming is pretty much essential for me on controllers and I had a fun cozy time.

My next (and probably last, at least for a while) spinoff venture will be [Pokemon Conquest](https://youtu.be/SaG5c-hZNBU), a tactical RPG for the DS that also serves as a crossover with Koei Tecmo’s longrunning TRPG series Nobunaga’s Ambition. I mainly bought it because I enjoy turn based strategy games, but I also looked at some top 10 lists and most if not all of them called Conquest the best Pokemon spinoff ever made. That’s pretty damn impressive given it didn’t sell all that well due to poor timing, launching in 2012 right in the middle of the Black and White 2 prelaunch hype cycle.

108eqb8,The Virtual Console COULD come back in SOME form," I don't mean to be an insider, but hear me out

Nintendo just added this thing to the Switch Eshop called ""Old School Classics"", which is just the NSO subscription services  
There is NO point for Nintendo making that, since they already have a dedicated section on the Eshop (and the Switch)  
So here is what I am thinking, this either means  
A: They are organizing stuff like Doom and Mario Bros and collections on the Switch to put onto there, so it is easier to get  
**OR**  
B: Nintendo is planning on bringing back Virtual Console in some form (and maybe they just wanted to dump on everything at the same time)

10675sw,What are your predictions for Mario game releases for 2023?,"Since the new Mario movie will release early this year, I think it would be a great opportunity to have a decently bigger year for Mario, at least compared to 2022. Here's what I expected for 2023:

A new 3D Mainline Mario game - I think it's the right time for a new mainline entry. Not only it's been 5 years (almost 6) since Odyssey, but it would also be perfect as a Holiday release alongside Zelda ToTK in the same year, similar to what happened in 2017. It could be Odyssey 2 or something completely different. I know that Bowser's Fury was released in 2021, but I feel like that was a more of side mode for the 3D World port than anything else. Also, I don't expect to be a mainline 2D game, because we already have NSMBUDX and SMM2, which it would have their respective sales be interfered by that game. Maybe on the next console as a reboot, or maybe not, who knows.

A new Donkey Kong game - It's been rumored from time to time and I think this would be a good year to release it. If it's going to be 2D, 2.5D, or 3D, that's a whole other story.

A third Mario Baseball game - That one is pretty straight forward. We got Mario Strikers: Battle League last year, so why not a baseball game? It's the only major Mario Sport series that the Switch still doesn't have. Although, it could also be released in 2024 instead.

Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 - And finally, the only game that I'm 100% sure that will be released this year. It's already been a tradition for a Mario & Sonic games to be released a few months before the year the Olympics is predicted to take place. The only exception being Rio 2016, that was released on the same year.

Miscellaneous (games that could be releasing this year but it wouldn't have much of an impact):

- Mario vs. Donkey Kong

- Dr. Mario



Games that I don't think we are going to see released this year:

Mario Kart 9 - We are already getting new Booster Courses in MK8DX, so a new Mario Kart game will only happen on the next console.

Another Mario Party game - We only get a new mainline Mario Party game for every 3 years since NDCube (9 in 2012, 10 in 2015, Super in 2018, and Superstars in 2021), so a 2024 release instead.

Another Paper Mario game - We only get a new Paper Mario game for every 4 years since Sticker Star (SS in 2012, CS in 2016, and TOK in 2020), so also a 2024 release.

Mario & Luigi - Despite being the 20th Aniversary of this series, the future of this series has been a mystery ever since AlphaDream got bankrupt, so it's safe to not expect anything from it (at least for now).

Wario Land - It's be 15 years since the last game of the series was released (2008), so I have no idea if it's going to come back or not.

Captain Toad sequel - Idk

There are other game sequels I didn't mention, but I would be repeated myself a lot, and most of them would be unlikely for simply already having games on the Nintendo Switch.

107mzik,“Evil creator gods” in my favorite Nintendo games ruin them for me.,"My favorite Nintendo games, Smash Bros. and the Fire Emblem series (spoilers included) have been stressing me out for a long time (I have autism) because some of these games hint themselves in being pro-dystheist (the belief that a deity responsible for the world’s creation is malevolent). This is a common thing with main antagonists in Square Enix and Atlus games, which I don’t like anyways, but it has plagued games I actually enjoy. As a disclaimer, I am not highly religious, in fact I am less religious than the average person, but anything regarding a “creator of the world” who wants to do bad things massively upsets me, both because I think this type of story writing and the whole belief of dystheism is really controversial, incredibly depressing, and that I struggle every day with a disability and depression (I don’t want to believe I was created for malevolent reasons!!!).

In the Smash Bros series, the evil Master Hand is the source of creation of the Smash world and Crazy Hand is the source of destruction. Similar with their masters, Galeem and Darkhon, but nothing about them is truly made clear. Master Hand has also been manipulated by Tabuu in Subspace Emissary and one of them, when freed from Galeem in World of Light, fought player-controlled against their minions in the near-end of the story mode. Overall there’s a lot of pseudo-dystheism (two evil hands representing creation and destruction of the world) and confusion the Smash lore that really stresses me out.

Not all Fire Emblem games stress me out, but certain ones that have a creator god/goddess do: Radiant Dawn’s Ashera and the Heroes’ app Alfador (who hasn’t even been made into a character yet). But also Three Houses’ Rhea/Seiros as an antagonistic Jesus figure. Ashunera is a goddess who creates the world of Tellius as well as the races of humans and human shape-shifters. When the clashing of her people and the racism between the humans and shape-shifters becomes a disastrous issue that challenges her emotionally, she splits herself into Ashera (order and reason) and Yune (emotion and chaos). Yune ends up destroying most of the world in a Genesis-esque flood and is sealed away in a cursed medallion, and Ashera becomes the alpha goddess. In the events of Radiant Dawn, Ashera is woken up from a sleep where she finds out the beings she created just won’t stop killing each other, and turns a lot of people into stone. Yune is freed from her medallion and is enlisted in Ike and Micaiah’s crew to stop Ashera from resetting the world, as well as the corrupt Begnion church. The good news is after defeating Ashera, Yune gets her to chill and they reform back into Ashunera. What affected me though in Radiant Dawn was the sense of “this seems dystheistic” when we find out Ashera, the goddess everyone prays to thanks to the corrupted church, plans to end the world, and quotes like “blind faith” or similar are used in the game.

In the Fire Emblem Heroes app, Alfador, creator god of Zenith, is a parody of Odin from Norse mythology and has two daughters named after Thor and Loki. Unlike mythology, both Thorr (as she’s called) and Loki are evil and carry out the malevolent orders of Alfador, quoted “he who created all” and similarly. Even though Alfador has not appeared in Heroes yet, his mentioning and the writing’s lean to pro-dystheism totally ruined the app for me.

In Fire Emblem Three Houses, Seiros is the daughter of the creator goddess Sothis (who thank goodness isn’t evil), identical to how Jesus in the Bible is the son of God. Seiros creates the Church of Seiros and is even celebrated in a holiday in late December like Jesus. That’s pretty much where the similarities end. Seiros/Rhea isn’t evil but not a great person (she’s the final boss “immaculate one” in Edelgard’s path) and that’s how the Jesus connection stressed me out.

Being a high fantasy game fan, I would like to play the two Xenoblade Chronicles games, but I also heard controversy on those games regarding religion.

Are these games’ obviously dystheistic moments included on purpose like someone wanting to spread a message to Western audiences? I would also like to know how to get over my stress and anxiety over this so I could enjoy gaming and continue to enjoy my favorite games.",mikeykun15,1,12,67,737,4284,0,0

With the knowledge Sony gained through the initial partnership, they made the PlayStation One. This console crushed the Nintendo 64 in sales.

106rp9t,What Nintendo must start doing in order for their games to regain appreciation again?,"So this is the thing: regardless the outstanding sales of Switch, Nintendo... is not in a good position lately. They keep getting a lot of crap, in the last year there have been multiple ""Nintendo sucks"" videos on YT, and the general userbase of Nintendolife has become vile and nasty torward it, and the worst thing is... all this hate is having repercussions on the general appreciation of the games.

It's true that Nintendo has made quite a few... debatable decisions with Switch, between the Joycon Drift and Switch Online not being quite good, but for how I see it, regardless these problems, Switch has one of the best lineups of any Nintendo console ever, and the fact that doesn't get much appreciation because of the way people see Nintendo... makes me really sad.

Also, this whole mess, has quite some hypocrisy in it: On the opposite, Sony lately has done plenty of crappy things, even worse than Nintendo's ones in the last year (like expensive services that are not that worthy, and a raise in the price of PS5 outside the US), but people easely forgiven them only because... God of War Ragnarok. Yeah, with a single game Sony managed to be forgiven for the crap they did lately. So why are not people as forgiving with Nintendo as they are with Sony since, you know, they released way more quality games than them in the last year? 

In any case, for how I see it, making quality games is not enough anymore for Nintendo, if they rewant the general appreciation from the fans, they need to do something else. The question is... what? What does Nintendo need to do to get appreciation again (and most importantly, that their games don't get unfairly hated because of this mess)? To you the word.",Dragalisk64,1,14,85,303,1710,0,0

106tbp8,Mario Kart: Double Dash doesn't truly support up to 16 players.,"It both does and doesn't.

I see this repeated a bit often by folks and I don't think they've ever tried it - granted, getting 16 players requires a lot of stuff.  Anywhoo, here's the deal.

Double Dash on the GameCube made use of Nintendo's Broadband Network Adapter to allow you to connect multiple GameCubes together and play (local) multi-player Mario Kart.  Double Dash also featured a unique ""love it or hate it"" mechanic where each Kart had two characters on it - a driver and a rider.  The effected gameplay in several different ways, but what is relevant to the discussion here is thatr, when playing, you could either have one player control one Kart (and two characters) or one player control one character (or half a kart).  What you can not do, in any multiplayer mode, is have one player control one kart while two players control a second kart.  Unless you make the one player use two controllers... which is really hard to do in Double Dash.

So, the breakdown:

1 TV, 1 GCN, 1 MK:DD and up to four controllers allows up to four players.  One player, one kart/two characters, 2 players, two karts/four characters, 2 players, one kart/one character each, 3 players, three karts/two characters each, 4 players, four karts/two characters each, our 4 players, two karts/one character each.

You can keep this up to 8 consoles linked together, but after 8 players (either eight karts/two characters each or four karts/one character each), you'll only be able to play with an even number of players - since you can't have more than eight karts, more than eight players requires each player to team up with another and play in pairs.  If you have 9, 11, 13, or 15 players, one person is SOL.  So, the game actually supports up to 8 players, or 10, 12, 14, or 16 players.

Now that I was feeling a bit nostalgic I decided to give Link's Awakening a chance on the Switch. As I understand it, the game's basically the same as in the 90s, save for the new cute graphics. And it really shows! For example, there's a room with three enemies. No hints whatsover. You kill them, nothing. You look around, nothing. You walk around the whole island thinking you missed something else, nothing. Finally, you go to YouTube and guess what? You have to kill them in specific order for treasure to show up.

104lai5,"What do you think of Square Enix’s decision to keep making throwback RPGs on Nintendo consoles (Bravely, Octopath, etc)?","It has now been over a decade since the original [Bravely Default](https://youtu.be/voh6NEpwEVY) was released back in 2012. That game was kind of a big deal for Square, as their attempts at moving forward with their flagship Final Fantasy franchise weren’t necessarily home runs. By the time the original Bravely came out in the West, the last two big Final Fantasy games we got were Lightning Returns and FF14 version 1.0, and that’s all I’m gonna say about those two. Still even though Square is looking big towards the future with games like Final Fantasy 16, FF7 Rebirth, and Kingdom Hearts 4, they didn’t forget their roots.

But that’s enough prologue, let’s talk about Team Asano. This group at Square Enix was indirectly formed by veteran producer Tomoya Asano, who made a name for himself with the 2009 DS title Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light. This game was a throwback to a simpler time for JRPGs, with classic tropes brought to life with new hardware and a job class system reminiscent of Final Fantasy 5. It got a decent amount of acclaim and a sequel would swiftly be planned out. Long story short, they wanted to make it a new IP for the upcoming 3DS instead and that’s how Bravely Default came to be.

As implied earlier Bravely’s success made waves for Square, and it helped them realize that there was still very much a market for more traditional RPGs in the modern age. We got a direct sequel a few years later with [Bravely Second](https://youtu.be/pGYP73s9rcM), another [standalone entry](https://youtu.be/Hv2Zvj49Y2g) for the Nintendo Switch in early 2021, and several other games that Asano also produced, all of which employ a striking new visual style dubbed “HD 2D”. Even if you never owned a 3DS, chances are that you’ve encountered at least one of these Switch games at some point or another, including:

**[Octopath Traveler](https://youtu.be/Fmi8KrntszI):** This was the debut title for Team Asano and Square Enix’s HD 2D line of games, crafting diorama-like depictions of 2D pixel sprites on 3D backgrounds. These looks are complimented with an engaging turn based battle system, an addicting job system, and eight individual character stories to sink your teeth into. It went on to sell over 2.5 million copies and spawn two sequels: a mobile prequel game with in app purchases, and a [standalone sequel](https://youtu.be/-jXBsqSXD0U) coming next month. Good times.

**[Triangle Strategy](https://youtu.be/7nhTJ-Evv_U):** Someone at Team Asano must’ve been like, “Hey let’s take that awesome visual style we made with Octopath and put it into a tactics game!” This reinvigorated the strategy RPG genre with a story of deep political intrigue and a moral choice system which can take you down one of several endings. The game was also a commercial success, selling nearly a million copies in its first month as a pure Switch exclusive. Looking forward to the eventual sequel, especially with how much Square loves strategy RPGs nowadays.

**[Live A Live](https://youtu.be/G0oOta9Lfts):** This was what many have been asking Square Enix to do with this graphics style: remake their older sprite based RPGs with it! And their first go at remaking a classic RPG was with a one-of-a-kind game that never originally released outside of Japan, one that Westerners mainly know about because Undertale took some inspiration from it. When this came out back in July 2022 exclusively for the Switch, it became many people’s RPG of the year, even beating out Xenoblade 3 in their eyes.

**[Dragon Quest 3](https://youtu.be/FmfiqydPjVk):** While people were begging Square to remake Final Fantasy 6 or Chrono Trigger in this style, Square Enix showed up at a Dragon Quest anniversary livestream and showed off this glorious HD 2D revival, stunning the eyes of many. As of this writing there is no concrete release window for this remake, but I’ll be sure to pick it up on day 1. I just personally hope it’s not right next to Tears of the Kingdom. That would really suck.",Asad_Farooqui,1,19,120,656,3995,0,0

1069hot,Why Nintendo's Motion Tracking Technology Succeeded Where Others Failed,"Have you ever wondered how Nintendo was able to get so many developers to create games for their motion tracking controllers, like the Wii Remote and the Joy-Con? While other companies, like Microsoft with their Kinect, struggled to attract developers to their own motion tracking technology.

Well, there are a few key reasons why Nintendo was able to succeed where others failed.

First and foremost, Nintendo's motion tracking controllers were simple and intuitive to use. The Wii Remote, for example, had just a few buttons and a built-in accelerometer, which made it easy for developers to create games that were accessible to a wide audience. In contrast, the Kinect required users to stand in front of their TV and make specific body movements, which was not as user-friendly.

Another reason for Nintendo's success was the fact that their motion tracking controllers were integrated into the hardware of their consoles. This meant that developers didn't have to worry about compatibility issues, as every Wii or Switch console came with the necessary controllers. On the other hand, the Kinect was an optional accessory for the Xbox, which made it harder for developers to justify the additional effort of creating games for it.

Finally, Nintendo's motion tracking technology was able to capture a wide range of movements, from simple gestures to more complex actions. This gave developers a lot of creative freedom when it came to designing games, as they could come up with all sorts of interesting and unique gameplay ideas.

So, there you have it – a few reasons why Nintendo was able to get developers to program for their motion tracking technology, while others like the Kinect struggled. Do you have any other thoughts or questions on this topic?",MrNobodyX3,1,9,71,289,1763,0,0
1050k55,Luigi's Mansion vs Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon,"I don't have any sources to back this up, but from what I've seen on the internet, people generally seem to prefer Luigi's Mansion 1 to Dark Moon. I was wondering why, for the sake of discussion.

One of the main talking points I see is that Dark Moon is mission based and linear, while the first game isn't, and that because the first game is more freeform, it's the better game. 
But that isn't true, right? There's a set path in Luigi's Mansion 1, railroaded to you through specific keys you have to obtain to unlock specific doors. There's no way to break from this path or forge your own way through the mansion. It's as linear as Dark Moon, maybe more linear since the mission structure in Dark Moon allows the previously visited environments to change between missions, always keeping backtracking interesting.

Sure, you can go back and explore previously unlocked rooms in 1, but why would you? You already explored them, and unless there's a boo that has fled in them or you're trying your luck for RNG treasure, you're done, and theres nothing new to look forward to. There's no compelling reason to backtrack...

...Except for the blackout, which does change things up in the first game by flooding you with ghosts. It also allows you another chance to collect ghosts/treasures and the only way to catch Uncle Grimmly. The blackout is the only time where backtracking is interesting in the game, and it's a shame it's the only standout in that department.

The other main point is ambiance and sound design, and that 1 had a much more spooky feel to it than Dark Moon. I fully agree, Dark Moon is definitely more silly and lighthearted compared to 1, and I feel more 'immersed' in the 1st game than I do in Dark Moon, which quite consistently undercuts the tension with jokes.

While per se I think it's almost granted that Switch's successor will come out next year, I don't think it will be revealed during this year, if not during December. For a simple reason: announcing it in the middle of the year would mine the sales of Switch for the rest of the year. Sure a reveal during the E3 would give it a lot of visibility, but that would ruin the sales of the current console for Christmas. 

So in the end, I feel Nintendo will play it strategically, and wait for the right time to properly announce it, and personally, I don't think it will be before December, or January 2024.

104hi51,Forgotten Mario characters that deserves a second chance.,"Hi r/nintendo. Greetings from Venezuela. Casually I've seen this sub and wanted to make a post about those mario characters that appeared only one time in a game and after that never showed again. Falling almost in the void of the forgotten ones.

I want to talk from two characters that appeared in Mario RPG games. These characters are Booster and Jojora. (I wanted to include Geno but because he is property of Square Enix and The license with Nintendo expired i Will not include him)


Let's begin with Booster. The totem like man that first appeared in Super Mario RPG legend of seven stars. This character celebrated a wedding without knowing exactly how. Also how to forget his ""Loco Express attack"" or the Uphill chase to Marrymore. A very funny character that i want to see again in a cameo or a easter egg reference.

And now Let's go with Jojora. The ice Fairy girl that debuted in Mario & Luigi Super Star Saga. This character deserves special mention. Not only for having a cute design, but also for being one of the strongest bosses in the game, at the point that looked a semifinal boss. When you defeat her, simply desappears and you don't find her anymore. That makes her a memorable character. And for that i hope Nintendo puts her in a future Mario game, at least in a minor appearence or a short major one.

Tell. You think Nintendo should include one of these characters in a future game?

104l2wi,Port Ragnarok Online to Nintendo Switch,"I mean a direct port of the PC version of the classic Ragnarok Online game. Not a reinvent like they've done with a lot of Ragnarok mobile games.

Make it work with the switch controls and the touch screen exactly as the game is. Clean it up a bit, sure, but don't change anything drastically.

Keep the music, the sprites, the animation and combat styles - all of it.

I'd say the only way RO could, or even should functionally be improved to be more accessible, would be to have it fully voice acted. At that point, it'd just be an unbeatable game IMO.

If Nintendo and Gravity actually sat down and spoke, they could make this work. And it would be absolutely massive for both of them in terms of sales.

I'm sure I'm not alone in being willing to shell out a pretty penny for a custom release Switch dedicated to Ragnarok Online if they do this.

RO is a very old game now, too. I was basically a kid when it came out and now I have a kid of my own who also loves to play RO but doesn't grasp PC gaming yet. I think this aspect of family bonding is also very in line with both Nintendo and Gravity and could be promoted as good way for parents and kids to bond and game together with a game that is really unlike anything else.",ournextarc,1,6,39,239,1231,0,0

However, touch screen technologically has gotten exponentially cheaper and better in the last decade. I think low end tablets are retailing for $30 USD right now?

This is a form factor/UI factor that has largely been unexplored by traditional AAA game developers. Mobile phone game developers have been honing the UI on this for years though and it's high time someone unifies this with your standard dualstick type controller.

Imagine playing Tears of the Kingdom, and instead of opening a menu to see your mini map, you don't even pause and just look at the map in your hands on the tablet while simultaneously seeing Link move on your big screen TV.

That small touch area in the middle of the PS5 is a good example too but as usual I expect Nintendo to be the true trailblazers of making intuitive fun UI.",russokumo,1,8,56,161,900,0,0

101g3bw,My Wishes for Kirby's Return to Dreamland Deluxe,"I am currently replaying *Kirby's Return to Dreamland* in anticipation for the remake. As a *Kirby* fan, I'm pretty excited! This is the first mainline remake since *Kirby Super Star Ultra,* the first *Kirby* game I ever played as a child. I think that this game with some tweaks can be as good, if not better, than the likes of *Triple Deluxe* or *Planet Robobot.* I'm not saying the game is bad; this entry is fantastic. I have a few ideas for how the game can improve, though they may be a little more technical:

\- More ability challenge rooms, please! Considering they added Mecha Kirby, it seems appropriate.

\- I hope that >!Extra Mode allows you to play as other characters than Kirby. I understand this might make the energy spheres harder to find, but the Arenas allow you to play as other characters after you clear them. Why not make Extra Mode the same? !<

\- I'm sure that the moveset tweaks from future games (minus *Forgotten Land*) will be incorporated (i.e. King Dedede, Meta Knight, and Bandana Dee's new moves from *Star Allies* coming back). I also hope attacks like Spinning Fire Breath for Fire and Revolution Beam from Beam return. Those attacks gave their abilities more midair options.

\- I hope the game adds some extra stages and >!new bosses. I'm 90% sure Morpho Knight will be in the game.!<

\- Finally, this last one may not be realistic, but I hope Super Abilities are modified in some way. In the Super ability sections, you kinda just do the same thing over and over again. The only Super Ability with any real puzzle solving is Flare Beam. In other games, the Robobot Armor and Mouthful Mode had more moves, puzzles, and options, so they felt more fun to use. In other words, I kinda want the Super Abilities to be more engaging. Right know, mechanically, they just feel like being able to use Crash Kirby over and over again with less frames...

So those are my two cents. What do you think?",Shamaleon34,1,8,48,346,1932,0,0
100sive,Pokémon Ranger 2: Shadows of Almia is an s tier Pokémon game,"I played through this game this year. The gameplay is drawing circles around Pokémon to gain their friendship. As you level up ranger rank you can have more Pokémon at once (up to 8 late game) and they all follow you around in the overworld. They all have one time use overworld abilities to eliminate obstacles. The gameplays pretty simplistic (hey, so are the mainline games), but the gameplay LOOP (haha) is really fun and actually gets pretty damn complicated in the late game. Just drawing loops around Pokémon is suprisingly satisfying, and also pretty difficult. The gameplays great, but that’s not where the game shines. The pixel art sprites of the game look really good, and I think are my favorite out of any older Pokémon game. The game has a lot of charm with the graphics, following Pokémon, and especially the dialogue. The dialogue and characters are without a doubt the best part of this game, when they’re usually insignificant in most mainline games. The humor is actually funny, even to me as a 15 yr old, unlike the “humor” in most Nintendo games. The characters are all pretty memorable and all contribute to the plot well. Speaking of which, while I won’t give any spoilers the plot is pretty damn good with your slow rise up the ranks starting as a student learning the basics of being a ranger. I would highly reccomend this game to any Pokémon fan, even if your just a fan of the concept and not the mainline games. I will say though DONT PLAY THIS GAME ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN DS/3DS HARDWARE! I played in on a N3DSXL with no issues, but playing on something without a touch screen + stylus would be absolutely miserable. Also if you’re on an XL model, you should hold start when launching the  game to play at original resolution. It’s not a huge deal or anything, but the pixel art looks a lot better, and imo it was better to play with the smaller chunk of the screen.",SquareRootOfChungus,1,12,60,342,1897,0,0
102bumy,Just finished Ocarina of Time for the first time on Switch...glad I never played it on N64.,"All I can say is: just glad I finished the damn thing! Yes, it was enjoyable at times, but it was most painful...for reasons I will get into...

First some background. I'm a lifelong Nintendo fan, owned every Nintendo home console from the SNES as a 9yo in 1995 to the Switch, Gamboy and DS. I played a bit of A Link to the Past but never finished it. Got BOTW when I got my Switch and loved it. Poured many hours into it, some of the fondest in my 30 years of console and PC gaming. One of the greatest games ever. Then I got Skyward Sword and thoroughly enjoyed it too...but as I implied, Ocarina of Time was mostly a chore to play through. For some reason, I never got it on my N64, and since then I'd heard many accolades, how it was such a classic etc, so was glad when I could play it on Switch ..unpopular opinion I know, but I'll say why. First the good:


First off, I'll say it isn't a bad game, and I can easily see why it's a classic. It established the template for future 3D Zelda games the way Super Mario 64 did Mario games. The music is so moving and memorable, the world vivid and story engaging. I genuinely had a lot of fun, but and it's a big but...

The first is probably a me thing..never been the best at puzzles, and I struggled a lot. Maybe I am dumb in this department lol. Never have I had to consult walkthroughs both video and text as much as this game. Not with Skyward Sword or BOTW. How the f**k would 12 yo me have coped in 1998? Would've definitely needed a guide. Some of the levels etc are just so cryptic...

Which leads me to Navi. What is the point of her if she barely actually gives you helpful hints? Like Fi in SS. Just says the same old things for the most part and sounds annoying lol.

The controls: maybe this is a Switch thing, but substituting the C buttons for an analog stick meant frequently selecting the wrong thing. Like say navi when you want to shoot an arrow or bomb when you want to hookshot or something. Needless to say this was so frustrating. 

Which brings me to Z targeting. Combat and boss fights were in a pain in the ass. When locked on your target often went off target and camera. I get it was 1998 but still, I felt most of the difficulty was dealing with that, otherwise they were fairly easy.

So yeah, while I did have some fun I just found Ocarina so frustrating to play...but at least it was on Switch where I could 'cheat"" with suspend points. No way would I have thr patience without it on N64. And I got all 120 stars in SMB World. I much preferred BOTW and Skyward Sword. Just my subjective opinion.",TheNamelessComposer,1,17,91,500,2580,0,0

So, I'm a LOOONG time lurker, and I do occasionally put up posts into this subreddit. I'm a huge Nintendo fan and have been my whole life! I was a Day 1 Switch owner, and I've loved my Switch since the day I bought it.

Now, this Christmas, I decided to purchase a Steam Deck due to the incredible emulation that I found out about... now, before I go any further, I'm not looking for this thread to be a discussion about how the Switch + Steam deck are similar/different.

One thing that really surprised me was quite how powerful the Steam Deck is - games like God of War and Horizon are able to run, and they don't look half bad. So, I'm genuinely curious, do we NEED a new piece of hardware soon? Or, is Nintendo going to continue on the trajectory its on, and keep allowing shovelware/bad versions of games to be released on their platform?

 * ***Wrecking Crew '98*** was released in 1998 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this action puzzle game, developed by *Nintendo EAD* with *Pax Softnica*, Bowser has built skyscrapers all over the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario sets out to take them down. Challenge each of the enemy characters in the story mode. Portions of wall drop from above and you have to break them or move them along conveyor belts. If the blocks reach the top of the screen then you lose. Destroy matching walls to drop unbreakable iron walls on your opponent.

   
   
 * ***Power Lode Runner*** was released in 1999 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this platform/puzzle game, developed by *T&E Soft*, you play as Mugurukun, as he collects the building materials found on each stage. Enemies wander about the stages, Muguruken's only defence is to blast holes in the ground. If enemies become trapped in the holes, they can be passed over safely. Be careful not to trap Muguruken in a hole, however, or the stage will have to be restarted.

   
   
 * ***Power Sōkoban*** was released in 1999 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this action/puzzle game, developed by *Atelier Double*, Medusa has trapped characters from Japanese folklore in her castle. You play as a demon as he escapes from the castle and works his way to Medusa, freeing all of his friends. Each screen of the castle contains a block puzzle. Push the rocks and drop them all into the holes to clear each stage. As you solve puzzles you will free your friends, and they will power you up to face the boss battles.

100ys3m,Nintendo’s 2023: Worst Case Scenario,"Last year I made a post talking about how Nintendo could royally screw up 2022. However that year has past and we are officially in 2023 so I am going to do it again. As before, this is only a parody and these predictions are not meant to be taken seriously.

January: Instead of announcing dlc for Scarlet and Violet, Gamefreak announces two new versions, Pokémon Hyper Scarlet and Hyper Violet for November of this year. The game features new areas based off Morocco and southern France (Kalos) however it fixes none of the performance or graphical issues from the original games.

February: A new Nintendo direct is posted, it is mainly focused on Tears of the Kingdom with a small update on Pikmin 4. However ToTK is criticized for the lack of new content compared to BoTW. Along with the direct Nintendo also announces a price increase to $70 for all of their first party games, including Pokémon. And their YouTube partner’s program is reinstated. A new mature 3D Mario game is announced produced by Miyamoto. Said to be a new reimagining that will redefine gaming and will be the next major step in not just the franchise but gaming as a whole.

March: Advance Wars 1 + 2 are canceled due to the war in Ukraine

April: The Super Mario Bros movie is released to nearly universal backlash. It gets a 20% on Rotten Tomatoes and is a box office flop, prompting Nintendo to cease their partnership with illumination

May: Tears of the Kingdom gets a last minute delay to July to “Deliver the ultimate Zelda Experience”

June: Pikmin 4 is randomly shadow dropped. While the game is okay, it suffered horribly from poor sales due to the game’s poor marketing, destroying all hopes that we would get a Pikmin 5. Nintendo announces a new 4K switch pro model to coincide with the new Mario game. It also supports 60fps, however it is over $500

July: Tears of the Kingdom Finally releases and and met with fairly positive reception (even in the worst case scenario, it’s still Zelda!) however it was criticized for being too similar to BoTW given the amount of time that has past. Since the last game.

August: Nintendo gets sued by a disgruntled employee for supposed racial discrimination. Despite these allegations being proven true, Nintendo wins the case due to the amount of money and their legal divisions. This leads to a mass exodus within the company.

September: A new direct is posted however it is considered by many to be the worst direct in ages, with the only first party announcement being a new Kid Icarus game,

October: The switch pro and the Mario game are released on the same day. However the new Mario is in a terrible state. With the game essentially being unfinished and broken. Devs come out about the game’s development, the game suffered horribly from development hell and some devs were literally worked to death just to get the game out. The game is so horrible it permanently ruined the reputation of the Mario franchise. On top of that, 50% of Switch Pros that were sold suffered from serious hardware defects. There are even some reports of people’s consoles exploding. 

November: Pokémon Hyper Scarlet and Hyper Violet are released. The games somehow are even more broken than the original. Along with the 70$ price tag, they became the worst selling Pokémon games in history.

December: The same disgruntled employee from earlier hires a hacker. Nintendo suffers a massive data breach, over 5 TB of data is leaked onto the internet. Everything from full early prototypes of all of Nintendo’s first party games from the 80s to today. Even all of their games that have yet to be announced, along with the source code was leaked.

For example, there are hundreds of Mario and Zelda fan games that Nintendo has never touched. 

All one has to do is search a site like itch.io for ""Mario"" or ""Zelda"" to see several free fan games that have had no claims or removals and have been available for years, many of them very high quality.

What Nintendo does shut down though are fan remakes of games, especially when they're planning on selling their own version soon. Also you often see takedowns for anyone who hosts ads, has monetization in their fan games or asks for donations.

It's actually really safe to make a fan game so long as you don't directly infringe upon an existing game.

zz4ar8,The Legend of Zelda Music Encyclopedia: an analysis of the theory and influences behind it (future games coming),"The music of the Zelda series is some of the most memorable and influential in video games. And in some of the games it even has a prominent role, being incorporated into the gameplay and as part of a cohesive narrative.

This is the reason why i wanted to see how it is made and the cultural and game design influences that go into it. This is why I was happy to learn that the actual music from the games made during the Nintendo 64 era (and even beyond!) lives inside the games' ROM files and code. After playing around a with some tools, I managed to get the original music files used. Everything is there, from the instruments used to the instructions on how they should be played, and the note sequences. Now we can get almost perfect reproductions of the music as standard music files. Thus, i decided to do a throughout analysis of the music and get as in-depth as possible into how it is made and what went into the compositions and sound design.

For the moment, i just finished the analysis of the two games of the Nintendo 64 era; with the resources, it was easy to make music visualization videos where you can see the exact notes played and all the instrument that go into each of the tracks. you can also check out additional media that helps to point out some aspects of the music. Here is a full playlist with each entry and the analysis; my wish is also to get more contributions and comments about each piece in order to get a complete understanding of the music, along with your thoughts on the tracks: [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVv3ELJlNuw&list=PLETz1iOEUzpfCNJZNECrGiCR-2HJKXy_p)

I hope this will be great to gain more appreciation for the music and a valuable resource for musicians and audio enthusiasts. An extensive investigation went into the music and I’m sure you will find lots of interesting info, specially of you are interested in media composition and how, with limited resources, the composers of the era managed to create the music in older system.

I also want to continue with the project and perhaps start incorporating different games and consoles in order to create video game music encyclopedia that can become a good reference for music enthusiasts. so if you have other soundtracks where you would like a similar treatment please let me know.

The original intention was to do the project in an even more interactive way, something where you can click on the particular set of instruments you want to hear at a time, but I have not found anything out there that can do that. If any of you know some way to do it I would be glad to know. Something like this: [https://streamable.com/x73wbt](https://streamable.com/x73wbt)

In any case, a lot of care was put into the making of these games and it shows in the music. so i hope you find it interesting. Please tell me what you think and you can ask me any questions about the soundtracks or how video game music was made, I am going to try to dig a little more info.

We need a CG emulator app on switch or releases of those games i hope in the upcoming few years they decide to really expand on there emulator apps and host a shit ton of classics because rn it’s simply not enough games.

People always point to the shots of Peach looking serious and confident in the trailer, and always assume that she’ll now be just a one-note competent warrior that only cares about being strong.

But I feel this shot during the Mario Vs DK fight is one that is severely overlooked by most people. It shows a glimpse at another side of Peach.
She isn’t begrudgingly shaking her head at the sight of Mario failing. She has a look of genuine concern and care for Mario. Letting out a feminine, Peach-like yelp and putting her hands to her chest at the sight of him getting pummeled.

The producer even stated that they wanted Peach to express “a wide range of emotions.” Peach will have a confident, leader side to her. But that feminine Peach side is still there. There’s just a little more going on with her now.

Perhaps when she gets to know Mario, she starts to open up, and reveals more of her vulnerable side throughout the movie.",JBBPro,1,17,85,170,1028,0,0
zwybid,Untangling the Mario and Donkey Kong Timelines - The Two Marios Theory,"The Super Mario and Donkey Kong series have a long shared history, full of enmities, camaraderie, and goodhearted rivalry.

At the heart of it all, however, lies one large contradiction. Today, I’d like to address this issue, and introduce you to an important revelation.

Please join me in this journey of studies, revelation, and arbitrary conclusions, as I introduce you to undeniable proof that there are, in fact, two Marios in the Super Mario and Donkey Kong cannon.

## The Two Marios

First off, let’s establish some preliminary facts, by going back to where these characters began.

## Donkey Kong - 1981

## [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Donkey\_Kong\_flier.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/14/Donkey_Kong_flier.jpg)

(Keep the cabinet art in mind, it’s going to be relevant later.)

This is the first appearance of both Donkey Kong and Mario. There are some important takeaways here:

**Fact 1: The original Donkey Kong, henceforth known as Donkey “Cranky” Kong Sr. is an adult ape in the early timeline.**

**Fact 2: At the time of Donkey Kong Arcade, Mario is an adult man.**

**Fact 3: Mario favors red overalls over a blue shirt.**

**Fact 4: Mario has a girlfriend named Pauline.**

**Fact 5: Mario works on a construction site.**

## Donkey Kong Jr. - 1981

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/Donkey\_Kong\_Jr.\_arcade\_promotional\_flier.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/Donkey_Kong_Jr._arcade_promotional_flier.jpg)

Moving right down release order, this game sees Donkey Kong Sr. captured by Mario and, if we are to follow lore materials, being treated rather poorly. In comes Donkey Kong Jr. to the rescue.

What can we glean here?

**Fact 6: Mario is capable of mistreating captive animals. (?)**

Considering the kind and heroic soul we know the modern Mario to be, this is a rather unusual revelation. Yes, I suppose he goes on to stomp and punch turtles all over, but those are acting agents under Bowser’s orders. This seems more like wanton cruelty than fighting back against an invading force. Let’s keep this in mind.

## Mario Bros - 1983

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/Mariobrothers.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/Mariobrothers.png)

Here, we meet Luigi, Mario’s brother. Before looking into him, however, let’s take some notes:

**Fact 3.2: Mario favors red overalls over a blue shirt in Donkey Kong, but blue overalls over a red shirt in Mario Bros.**

**Fact 5.2: Mario works on a construction site, then as a plumber.**

The change in clothes is easily explicable as simply varying his wardrobe, but what’s with the profession change?

Luigi’s presence also raises a question:

**Mystery A: Where was Luigi at the time of Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.?**

One would think that the heroic Luigi would join his brother in rescuing Pauline, and perhaps talk some sense into his animal-abusing brother?

Let’s keep that in mind as we move on.

## Wrecking Crew (1985)

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Wrecking\_Crew\_cover.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Wrecking_Crew_cover.jpg)

We see Mario as a solo act once more. What’s more, in the single player mode of Vs. Wrecking Crew, the arcade version, Luigi acts *against* him.

What more, Mario is back in the red overalls and blue shirt, and back at construction and demolition work.

This is getting very confusing, isn’t it? Let’s recap so far, adding our new knowledge.

**Fact 1: The original Donkey Kong, henceforth known as Donkey “Cranky” Kong Sr. is an adult ape in the early timeline.**

**Fact 2: At the time of Donkey Kong Arcade, Mario is an adult man.**

**Fact 3: Mario favors red overalls over a blue shirt when working on construction sites, but blue overalls over a red shirt when working as a plumber.**

**Fact 4: Mario has a girlfriend named Pauline.**

**Fact 5: Mario works on a construction site sometimes and as a plumber at other times.**

**Fact 6: Mario’s brother Luigi is a helpful ally while working as a plumber, but has an unexplained enmity when working as demolition workers.**

**Mystery A: Where was Luigi at the time of Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.?**

**Mystery B: Why is Luigi opposing Mario in Vs. Wrecking Crew, and absent in Wrecking crew?**

With that in mind, let’s move on.

## Super Mario Bros. series (Various)

[https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/10\_share\_images/portals\_3/2x1\_SuperMarioHub.jpg](https://fs-prod-cdn.nintendo-europe.com/media/images/10_share_images/portals_3/2x1_SuperMarioHub.jpg)

In the interest of brevity, I’m rolling in together every ‘Mushroom Kingdom’ Mario game. If Donkey Kong isn’t involved at all and there’s no specific insights to be gleaned from other games, they’ll simply be counted here.

What do we learn?

Now that we’re getting a good look at Mario, he’s looking somewhat younger, isn’t he?

Look at that smiling mug above. Does this look like the same “Jumpman” who went up against Donkey Kong Sr.?

Must be an art shift, right?

Let’s table that for now.

**Mystery C: Why does Mario suddenly look much younger?**

Mario’s back in the blue overalls, and on excellent terms with his brother. Why, we’re just flipping back and forth, aren’t we?

## Super Mario Kart (1992)

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/38/Supermariokart\_box.JPG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/38/Supermariokart_box.JPG)

Looks like Mario and pals are getting along great, and it seems that Donkey Kong Jr. is along for the ride.

Hm.

I don’t know about you, but if a man held my father captive and mistreated him, then used all kinds of traps to stop me from rescuing said father, I wouldn’t exactly want to go karting with him.

Admittedly, Bowser is also here, but… You know Bowser, he’s a big doofus when he’s not actively being a villain.

**Mystery D: Why does Donkey Kong Jr. happily join the Kart racing with Mario and pals?**

Okay, it’s been a big journey to get here, but we’re getting to the heart of the mystery. This is the big one.

## Donkey Kong Country series (1994+)

[https://mario.wiki.gallery/images/4/4f/Crankys\_Video\_Game\_Heroes\_DKC2.png](https://mario.wiki.gallery/images/4/4f/Crankys_Video_Game_Heroes_DKC2.png)

Here, we are introduced to a key figure, and someone who causes our entire timeline to unravel.

Enter Donkey Kong. Again.

Showing up alongside Donkey “Cranky” Kong Sr., it’s the son of Donkey Kong Junior, henceforth known as **Donkey Kong III**. This is the heroic ape we all know and love.

But… wait a minute.

Old Cranky’s looking like age has been taking a toll, hasn’t he?

Mario, though? Mario’s looking fresh as a daisy. If anything, he’s significantly younger than the old ape’s former nemesis.

What’s up with that?

This is where it all comes together.

The inexplicable return to youth. The flipflopping wardrobe and occupation. The convoluted brotherly relationship.

It all points to a simple conclusion:

This isn’t the same Mario. This Mario is Mario “Super” Mario Jr., son of Mario “Jumpman” Mario Sr., and brother of Luigi Mario.

Let’s go over the facts with that in mind:

**Fact 1: The original Donkey Kong, henceforth known as Donkey “Cranky” Kong Sr. is an adult ape in the early timeline.**

**Fact 2: At the time of Donkey Kong Arcade, Mario “Jumpman” Mario Sr. is an adult man.**

**Fact 3: Mario Sr. favors red overalls over a blue shirt. Mario Jr. favors blue overalls over a red shirt.**

**Fact 4: Mario Sr. has a girlfriend named Pauline, who may or may not be Mario Jr. and Luigi’s mother.**

**Fact 5: Mario Sr. works on construction sites. Mario Jr. works as a plumber and adventurer.**

**Fact 6: Mario’s brother Luigi is an ally to his brother but has opposed his father in the past.**

**Mystery A: Where was Luigi at the time of Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr.? - ANSWERED: Luigi was not born yet.**

**Mystery B: Why is Luigi opposing Mario in Vs. Wrecking Crew, and absent in Wrecking crew?**

**POTENTIALLY ANSWERED: Because Luigi has some issues with his father. Potentially, Mario Sr. treats children the same way he treats captive animals. In either case, this is no longer contradictory with other facts.**

**Mystery C: Why does Mario suddenly look much younger?**

**ANSWERED: Because this isn’t the same Mario, but his son.**

**Mystery D: Mystery C: Why does Donkey Kong Jr. happily join the Kart racing with Mario and pals?**

**ANSWERED: This isn’t the Mario who oppressed his father. Perhaps they were finding common grounds and making amends between their families?**

It’s all coming together.

When you look at it through this lens, everything makes sense.

Don’t believe me, let’s rapid fire through some more games:

## Mario’s Tennis (1995)

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/Mario%27s\_Tennis.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/Mario%27s_Tennis.jpg)

Once again, Donkey Kong Jr. is happy to hang with Mario Jr. and Luigi. Clearly, they haven’t let their fathers’ enmity get in the way.

## Mario Tennis (1995)

[https://outsidergaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mario-Tennis-Player-Select.jpg](https://outsidergaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mario-Tennis-Player-Select.jpg)

Donkey Kong III joins in the fun. Why does Jr. look and act younger than his son, though? Is this just timey-wimey nonsense?. Baby Mario (Jr.) is here alongside his adult self, so that could explain it, but…

**Mystery E: How does Donkey Kong Jr. look and act younger than Donkey Kong III?**

Donkey Kong III goes on to appear in many, many Mario spinoffs, but these have nothing notable to add to this theory.

## Yoshi’s Island DS. (2006)

[https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616MQCAF11L.\_AC\_SX425\_.jpg](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616MQCAF11L._AC_SX425_.jpg)

Well look at that, here’s Donkey Kong III as a baby, alongside Baby Mario “Super” Mario Jr., confirming the above timey wimeyness of Mario Tennis.

## Mario Vs. Donkey Kong series (various)

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/Mario\_vs.\_Donkey\_Kong\_Coverart.png](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/71/Mario_vs._Donkey_Kong_Coverart.png)

This series of game sees Mario Jr. and Donkey Kong III at similar antics to their fathers, but with one very notable difference: Donkey Kong here is acting out of misguided desire, rather than fury and anger. In each and every one, the game ends with an apologetic Donkey Kong being consoled and often presented with a consolation prize.

While Mario Jr. does keep his simian counterpart in check, this is far closer to tough love than it is to enmity.

What about Pauline, though?

If Pauline is Mario’s mother, or at least his father’s former lover, what’s going on here?

Let me ask you simply:

[https://cdn.staticneo.com/w/donkeykong/Pauline.PNG](https://cdn.staticneo.com/w/donkeykong/Pauline.PNG)

[https://mario.wiki.gallery/images/1/11/MKT\_Artwork\_Pauline.png](https://mario.wiki.gallery/images/1/11/MKT_Artwork_Pauline.png)

Do these two look like the same woman to you?

There’s clearly two Paulines. Mario Jr.’s maybe-mother in blonde, and the mayor of New Donk City in brunette.

Let's follow up on that:

## Super Mario Odyssey (2017)

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8d/Super\_Mario\_Odyssey.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8d/Super_Mario_Odyssey.jpg)

Mayor Pauline is here again alongside Mario Jr. and Luigi. Furthermore, New Donk City holds references to both the arcade original and Donkey Kong Country, suggesting that this takes place following Donkey Kong III’s adventures.

We know that Donkey Kong III's adventures have already happened. This means that some of New Donk City's streets were named following these adventures.

Either Mayor Pauline is a different woman from the original Pauline, or enough years have passed for Donkey Kong Sr. has aged enough to become the cantankerous elderly Cranky Kong while Pauline hasn't aged a single day.

The 'two paulines' hypothesis simply works much, much better with the timeline.

This leaves us with just one thorny question to answer:

## Donkey Kong (Gameboy, 1994)

[https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/t\_share/MTc0NDU3MDQzMzI2MTQ5OTky/why-is-dk94-so-genius.png](https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/t_share/MTc0NDU3MDQzMzI2MTQ5OTky/why-is-dk94-so-genius.png)

From the visual presentation, this game undeniably features Donkey Kong III, Mario “Super” Mario Jr., and Mayor Pauline of New Donk City. Furthermore, the ending photo establishes a similar tone to the Mario vs. Donkey Kong game, that all is forgiven.

The question is: That little ape is is acting even more as a subordinate to Donkey Kong III than he did in Mario Tennis. Unlike Mario Tennis, we can’t even assume this is the same baby timewarp phenomenon as with Baby Mario.

Once again, we’re faced with Mystery E.

**Mystery E: How does Donkey Kong Jr. look and act younger than Donkey Kong III?**

I see one possibility here: This Donkey Kong Jr., the same as the one in Mario Tennis (64), is Donkey Kong “Junior” IV, who is named for his grandfather, Donkey Kong ""Junior"" II.

## Conclusion:

I believe we’ve hit every relevant game to scope out data points, and the verdict looks clear to me:

We’re looking at two Marios and four Donkey Kongs.

You might ask, though: What happened to Mario Mario Sr.? Where has he been?

My personal theory:

Getting a little too old for construction work, Mario Mario Sr. decided to go back to school and studied medicine.

[https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ssb/images/1/16/Dr.\_Mario\_-\_Super\_Smash\_Bros.\_Ultimate.png](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ssb/images/1/16/Dr._Mario_-_Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate.png)

Education helped him mellow out and make amends with both his son and the Kong clan. Dr. Mario “Jumpman” Mario Sr. now works as a medical expert, curing viral infections and occasionally joining in the Super Smash Bros. tournament to hang out and duke it out with his children and his old nemesis's successor.",Cydrius,1,12,70,2003,14044,0,0
zw6d3y,"Why are Custom Robo's 1 and 2 exclusive to the Japanese NSO, as well as Harvest Moon 64? Better yet, why are we still doing exclusive games per region?","I found this weird. I don't see why we can't have Custom Robo's 1 and 2 for the American release. Besides translating, it'd just make sense, and it feels off-putting, since with each service, it seemed as if we were getting less exclusives per region, to the point where it seemed we weren't getting any more exclusives per region. But while I kinda understood Custom Robo, Harvest Moon made NO sense. Not only did it ACTUALLY RELEASE IN AMERICA, but Japan got it in SEPTEMBER (aka, when we got nothing, including the ""GoldenEye for 2023"" thing). 

But on the other hand, why didn't Japan get Pokemon Puzzle Leauge? It's Pokemon, and since Japan DIDN'T get Doctor Mario 64, it'd be the ONLY Puzzle game Japan would have, but they just didn't. I get it for NES/SNES, as the games Japan were getting were games Japan would be more interested in, but for crying out loud, why can't American's just play Custom Robo, but why also lock away all the puzzle games from Japan?

What instead happens to me though is that any little movement of the controller moves the camera wildly about, since the gyro is constant instead of just for aim. What I think would be best would be the gyro being a toggle so that you can aim with the stick and then press a button for the gyro fine-tuning.

zv3084,How Xenoblade Almost Didn’t Make It to America: A Brief History of Operation Rainfall,"It’s almost hard to believe that Xenoblade Chronicles, a relatively new Nintendo series, has quickly become such a household name in the JRPG space. The Switch has blessed the world with more entries in this series than any other, and Nintendo assuredly has this IP in their good graces now, much like Fire Emblem. But it wasn’t always sunshine and rainbows. To see how this series fought so hard to get the recognition it rightfully earned, we need to travel back to the twilight years of the Wii era.

The year is 2010. After a strong first few years delivering high quality first party titles, the Wii’s library slowed to a crawl and gave way to more casual games and mountains of shovelware. While there were still a handful of big titles planned for that year like Mario Galaxy 2, Kirby’s Epic Yarn, and Sonic Colors, most of the heavy hitters had come and gone by this point. Meanwhile on the other side of the pond, Japan was priming up its holiday season with a trio of role playing games exclusive to the Wii: The Last Story (developed by the folks behind Lost Odyssey), Pandora’s Tower (developed by a studio primarily known for licensed Shonen Jump titles), and finally Xenoblade Chronicles.

All three games would release in Japan from late 2010 though early 2011. European localizations of all three titles would also be confirmed (courtesy of Nintendo of Europe), and they would all be published by Nintendo in the region. Xenoblade’s director Tetsuya Takahashi was under the impression that the games would naturally all be localized in North America… but that didn’t happen. Nintendo of America stayed tight-lipped on the situation for most of the year, and they even actively stopped Nintendo of Europe from showing off Xenoblade themselves at E3 2011. After seeing all these attempts by NOA to sweep the games under the rug, it was up to the fans… to end the drought.

Born in an IGN message board post in mid-2011, a group of passionate volunteers announced they were galvanizing into a movement to bring more hardcore titles (not just RPGs) to North America. Their campaign, dubbed Operation Rainfall, focused their efforts on the three RPGs already mentioned, and they were damn persistent. They sent emails, signed petitions, and bombarded their Facebook and Twitter accounts demanding that NOA release the games in North America. They even managed to force the Amazon preorder listing for Xenoblade, then only known under its placeholder name “[Monado](https://youtu.be/CPI4WLEQ5as)”, all the way to #1, beating out Ocarina of Time 3D. Another important detail to note was that if Nintendo wasn’t going to publish the games themselves, the campaign would pitch them to another Japanese publisher that would, like Atlus or NIS America. Nintendo did get fans’ hopes up with a generic “never say never” post on Twitter, but didn’t say another word until that holiday season.

Thankfully this story does have a happy ending after all. On December 2, 2011, victory was achieved as Nintendo finally announced that Xenoblade would be released in North America on April 6 as a GameStop exclusive. And this wasn’t the end, as on the same day as its European launch, The Last Story would also be confirmed for North America courtesy of XSeed Games. These two titles finally coming over was a great sign surely, but there was no word of Pandora’s Tower getting an American release. But then out of the blue in early 2013, XSeed Games announced they would publish Pandora’s Tower in the States later that April, much to the campaign’s bewilderment. After nearly two whole years, Operation Rainfall was declared a success, and the original website has since been disbanded. We won.",Asad_Farooqui,1,14,85,620,3691,0,0

All You Can Eat... and the eShop debacle,"So my niece and nephew got Switch Lites for Xmas and as I already had one, I decided to look for games that can be played multiplayer online. I've seen some gameplay of Overcooked and thought it would be perfect chaos we could enjoy. So we each bought a copy of Overcooked for $1.99 usd on the eShop. Turns out it doesn't have online multiplayer.

 I decided to look up games on google and ran across Overcooked 2 on a list of online multiplayer games and decided to spend $7 usd to get it and see if it would have multiplayer we could play. Turns out it does and it is great fun.

Then I started to surf the Great Deals section of the eShop, in the 2nd row is both Overcooked 1 and Overcooked 2 right next to each other, but **15 rows** below that, with a smaller Overcooked logo, is Overcooked! All You Can Eat for $9.99 usd that has Overcooked 1 and 2 and all the DLC... 

I would've just bought that first if it was next to the others... I just think its kinda stupid that the first two would be next to each other on the top of the Great Deals section of the eShop and essentially the complete edition is buried further done. Sorry for the rant...

We already got a tease of it in [the ""Mushroom Kingdom"" clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-3sYL7vJTQ), and I love how many games they're pulling from, from Super Mario World to Super Mario Odyssey.

&#x200B;

So I got a three-part question for you. Answer any you like.

1. What are some Mario songs, from any game in the franchise, that you'd love to see represented in the movie's score?
2. What scene(s) do you think they'd work well in?
3. Any predictions for what will actually happen?

&#x200B;

I'd love to see a rendition of [Koopa's Road](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb59ARck26Q) from Super Mario 64. I think it would work so well in an climatic action sequence where Mario makes his way through Bowser's Castle, jumping through a gauntlet of traps, fireballs, and platforming sections before his final confrontation with the King of Koopas himself.  


Oh, and Ending Credits for the movie *has* to be [Super Mario World's ending theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNcIAC30mWI). I would've loved SM64's, but SMW's is just too grand to pass up the opportunity.",preetcolors,1,12,58,181,1154,0,0

I feel that the best thing about those games is how unique they are because, unlike the Mario games, Wario does not have a set theme, level design, or characters overall, Wario: Master of Disguise proved that point greatly.

I hear a lot of people on youtube claiming the switch has post-peaked...  But although these people obsess about the next biggest thing every month, I see that the Switch still has a lot of juice in it still with its monumental casual consumer base, and with many developed countries in recession or heading into one due to different economic factors families and casual gamers will be looking for games to play rather than new consoles.

I would like to see what the community thinks could be announced in 2023

zub5vs,"Severe vulnerability ""ENLBufferPwn"" found in many first party Nintendo games for the 3DS, Wii U and Switch","A severe vulnerability (CVE-2022-47949) has been found in the network code of many first party Nintendo games since the 3DS. Combined with other techniques, it allows remote code execution in the victim's console by just having an online game session with the attacker, including full console takeover (as demonstrated with Mario Kart 7 in the vulnerability report). Using the vulnerability, it is theoretically possible to do other malicious activities, such as **stealing account/credit card information** or **taking unauthorized audio/video recordings using the console built-in mic/cameras**.

Here is a list of games that are known to have had the vulnerability at some point (all the Switch and 3DS games listed have received updates that patch the vulnerability, so they are no longer affected):

* Mario Kart 7 (fixed in v1.2)
* Mario Kart 8 (still not fixed)
* Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (fixed in v2.1.0)
* Animal Crossing: New Horizons (fixed in v2.0.6)
* ARMS (fixed in v5.4.1)
* Splatoon (still not fixed)
* Splatoon 2 (fixed in v5.5.1)
* Splatoon 3 (fixed in late 2022, exact version unknown)
* Super Mario Maker 2 (fixed in v3.0.2)

There was something that always bugged me about Nintendo for a while that I feel I want to talk about, and that's their habit of reusing the same assists and voice clips from some of their games to use in their newer games. What made me talk about this was when Daisy was first introduced in Mario Strikers Battle League where a lot of her voices clips sounded familiar, until I realized that they were ripped from Mario games for the Wii and Wii U. There's also the fact that some characters in the Smash Bros series still use their brawl voice clips as well the Pokemon models from Sword and Shield being reused from the 3ds games. 

I'm not complaining or making a big deal out of this, I'm just really curious as it's starting to becoming a common thing that the Company is starting to do.

One last thing, Nintendo even reuses Character Renders and Artwork from random games. For example, The Amiibo cards from Mario Sports Superstars literally reuses existing artwork, mostly in a bad ""obvious Photoshopped"" way.",Ok-Cookie7598,1,10,57,183,1029,0,0

Nintendo themed Hanafuda Decks

You can find a list of hanafuda decks that Nintendo has produced here:

Of course, the best ones are the video game themed ones

We have the Mario Napoleon set

Mario Wiki also pointed out two promo images that have teeny little hanafuda cards, what a treat

Toad is holding one on the left and I know it’s hard to see on the right, but it’s tucked away behind on the left of the chain chomp painting

Pokémon hanafuda deck – this set also got heavily merchandised with keychains, pins, and coasters

Set of Pokémon x Mario cards

Kirby also got a Hanafuda set \^\^

Their crazy blend of action RPG combat, world exploration, and intricate epic storytelling have touched the hearts of many over the past decade or so. And North Americans almost didn’t get this series initially.

The numbered Xenoblade entries revolve around a set cast of characters exploring a fantasy world drenched in mystery. The first game starred Shulk, the third game starred Noah and Mio… and the second game stars [Rex](https://youtu.be/zHe0xC9OA2s). He is a young salvager living amongst a sea of clouds, trying to make an honest living until he comes into contact with the special person named Pyra. Voiced by Al Weaver in English, Rex has garnered mixed reception by critics and fans over the past 5 years for a variety of reasons.

But regardless, he was the star of the best selling Xenoblade game at that time, selling nearly 2.5 million copies in total. Rex would go on to receive a Mii costume for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and serve a supporting role in Pyra and Mythra’s moveset when they were added as DLC in early 2021.

(8-bit/16-bit era),"I dream frequently of top down Zelda, classic side scrolling mario, side scrolling Mega man (classic, x, zero). Top down Final Fantasy/Dragon Quest (All of which have appeared on Nintendo consoles). 

Often if I play my dreams long enough they'll go through some parts of games that I've never seen before, like levels, stages, boss fights, dungeons that aren't in real life.

Sometimes it will be like I'm plugging in this or that old Game cartridge for the SNES or GameBoy and seeing this whole new world open up of games and levels that have never existed, but in the classic greys and greens of the gameboy, or the sprite art of NES or SNES. Sometimes I'll even dream about the 3D worlds from Legend of Zelda and new ways of structuring massive dungeons.

I don't really play games as often as I used to. But it's like some part of me is sad that such a beautiful era is in the distant past. And dreams are essentially creative playgrounds for writing.

What do I do with these dreams? It's tricky trying to describe them in ways that are 'new', but are really just attempts to see old games and worlds in new ways.

I'm not sure what direction these dreams can take me in the real world. I'm just holding onto memories, hoping that when I do step back into the games again, I'll feel a weird feeling of deja vu, not just that I'm remembering a dream, but that the effect carries into living out a dream.

Who else feels like they've had similar visions?

 * ***Mega Man II*** was released in 1991 for the Game Boy in Japan. In this action platformer game, developed by *Capcom* with *Japan System House*, Mega Man takes a trip through time to stop the evil Dr. Wily! Dr. Wily is up to no good and this time he has stolen the experimental Time Skimmer that allows him to travel years into the future. Meanwhile, Mega Man and his trusty sidekick, Rush, are sent on a mission to investigate an underground lair. At arrival, the duo immediately come face-to-face with a group of Robot Masters!

   
   
 * ***Pinocchio*** was released in 1996 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this puzzle/adventure game, developed by *Virgin Studios London*, intertitles are used between levels to convey the story, in the form of a children's storybook. Pinocchio travels from home and must choose to go to School or Easy Street (though the choice does not affect the level order). He then travels from Stromboli's marionette show to Pleasure Island and then into the sea, where he saves Geppetto from inside Monstro and they escape.

   
   
 * ***Kousoku Card Battle: Card Hero*** was released in 2007 for the Nintendo DS in Japan. In this card battle RPG, developed by *Intelligent Systems* with *Nintendo SPD*, Satoru's childhood friend, Haruka, introduces him to the Card Hero card battle game. Help Satoru work his way through the tournaments and become the Card Hero master. Build a deck and use your Monsters to protect your Master Card as you take out the opponent Master. The matches are played with new Speed Battle rules.

zs0v4o,Losing characters in the Mario Kart series should smile and clap instead of crying. [Idea],"Since there is no way to actually contact the game developers, maybe somebody at Nintendo will read this and think ""Good idea"" and pass the message along. 

My 4 year old loves the Mario franchise, and especially Mario kart, but i just noticed a potential situation that Nintendo could improve with future installments. 

She's not very good at video game yet, and even though the game does a very good job at holding her hand and helping her steer and stay on the track, she still regularly comes in last. 

Normally she doesn't notice, and thinks she<s won just for crossing the finish line, but today she noticed something different... the expression on Toadette's face after she crossed the finish line. 

The character does a sort of sniffle with her hand to her eyes, and my daughter realized something was wrong and asked me why she wasn't happy...

So i told her she was just sneezing lol

She still thinks she won, and is happily playing along, but now must think toadette has really bad allergies lol

Nintendo is a VERY child friendly company, so wouldn't it be a good idea to teach children the value of losing with dignity by instead of crying about a loss, they happily clap for the winners? Happy for their success and not upset about their own loss?

I dunno, just a simple little idea. Many of the characters to this clapping animation already, just not when the blatantly lose lol.

zqy4lp,An idea I had for a Nintendo arena shooter crossover,"Imagine something like an Unreal tournament or Half life 2 deathmatch combined with Smash bros. The roster would have 20-25 Nintendo or even third-party characters. Every character would have their own moveset and style of play. For example, Samus would play more like Metroid prime while a character like Link would play more like in links crossbow training.

It would be in a first-person view and would have you fight a 1v1,5v5,10v10 or 20v20 player match. On different maps from different series, (Peaches castle, Hyrule, A pokemon stadium, DK island, etc)

There would also be vehicles players could drive and mount. There would start as small as a skateboard to being able fully to control vehicles like the Arwing, Samus's ship, etc.

There would be upgrades for each character making them stronger via weapons and power-ups at specific points on a map.

Similar to Smash bros. Each new game would add and cut new characters, They would be announced via Reveal trailers.

There would be other game modes. like a sports gamemode or a hide and seek. basically like TF2's style of game modes. And it would have a fully featured stage builder

The game would mainly focus on split screen Co-op but also has online play with 3 different difficulties: light, medium, and hard

And lastly, the game would have a main campaign/Story mode with fully voiced cutscenes

&#x200B;

Edit: I feel like I need to explain the game better

The game is a 3D arena shooter crossover of Nintendo characters set in up to 20v20 battles in different stages/ arenas. The game starts being unique in its unique classes that aren't your standard ""heavy"" ""lightweight"" ""stealth"" and ""engineer"" classes. all characters remain fast and bouncy control-wise but have unique moves, weapons, and upgrades.",thebestman3242343,1,10,52,295,1778,0,0

zoyrmi,What are the best implementations of motion controls on Nintendo consoles in your opinion?,"The Wii has a stigma of being a console with a fruitless controller gimmick and being just for kids and grandparents, on top of the “too much shovelware” schtick that it already gets. But flash forward to today and you’ll see the Wii’s influence everywhere, from VR setups to gyro aiming on more traditional controllers. Like it or not the Wii did change game control for Nintendo forever, even if many didn’t realize it at the time. So let’s look at that for second; what are some amazing first and third party uses of motion controls on Nintendo’s consoles that you can mention? I’ll quickly shout out a couple that I loved right here:

When Nintendo ported GameCube games to the Wii as part of the New Play Control line, we got the definitive versions of Pikmin and Metroid Prime out of it in my opinion. The pointer aiming was seamless and I can’t imagine going back to aiming on a controller for those games. Wario Land Shake It and the Wii exclusive MadWorld are pretty satisfying and visceral displays of gesture controls, as the context for those shakes warranted it and wouldn’t feel as reward with just button mashing.

 * ***Final Fantasy*** was released in 1987 for the Family Computer in Japan. In this role-playing game, developed by *Square*, the world lies shrouded in darkness. The winds die... The sea rages... The earth decays... But the people believe in a prophecy, patiently awaiting its fulfilment. ""When darkness veils the earth, four Warriors of Light shall come..."" After a long journey, four young travellers did at last appear... and in the hand of each was clutched a crystal.

   
   
 * ***Mario Party*** was released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64 in Japan. In this party game, developed by *Hudson Soft*, Mario doesn't spend all his days jumping around and kicking Bowser's behind from here to the moon - he's also the biggest party animal on the face of the Earth. Glimpse how Mario celebrates all the victories he's had over the years with *Mario Party*, a game that - along with its sequels - is unlike any other for the N64, offering some of the system's greatest multiplayer gaming.

   
   
 * ***Pokémon Trading Card Game*** was released in 1998 for the Game Boy Color in Japan. In this digital collectable card game, developed by *Hudson Soft* with *Creatures*, based on the incredibly popular Pokémon Trading Card Game, this Game Boy Color version was a hit with gamers and card collectors alike. Explore the game world to find opponents and gather info. Learn how to build and manage decks, win battles to receive booster packs, then take on the eight Club Masters.

   
   
 * ***Starship Patrol*** (known as ***Starship Defense*** in North America) was released in 2009 for DSiWare in Europe. In this strategy/tower defence game, developed by *Q-Games*, defend your starship fleet from waves of enemy attacks using a combination of strategic skills and resource management. Plan your defence on the Touch Screen by attaching weapons to your ships in strategic positions. Use energy collected from defeated enemies to purchase new and more powerful weapons, and look out for rare power crystals that unlock advanced attacks, including the ability to summon a devastating black hole!

 * ***Mega Man X*** was released in 1993 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this action/platform game, developed by *Capcom*, when the *Mega Man* series made the technological leap from NES to Super Nintendo, so too did Mega Man himself. Set one hundred years after the original hero's adventures, *Mega Man X* stars a more powerful generation of robot known as X who - along with the maverick Zero - must take on a new threat: the reploids.

   
   
 * ***Mario Party 2*** was released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64 in Japan. In this party game, developed by *Hudson Soft*, what do you do when your first party is a raging success? You throw another one, of course! Mario and all of his famous friends have long since RSVP'd for *Mario Party 2*, so you'd be a fool to miss this fiesta. Like the original *Mario Party*, this star-studded sequel allows up to four players to compete in exciting interactive board games packed with surprises.

   
   
 * ***Star Wars Episode I: Racer*** was released in 1999 for the Game Boy Color in PAL territories. In this racing game, developed by *Pax Softnica*, entirely different gameplay from its console and PC counterparts feature. The Game Boy Color hardware is technically incapable of rendering the 3D graphics used in the other versions, so the game was instead based on abbreviated tracks with an overhead 2D view. It also has an additional ""Rumble"" feature, in which a AAA battery may be inserted into the game card to activate vibration.

   
   
 * A third wave of **Animal Crossing amiibo Figures*** was released in 2015 in Japan and includes *Blathers*; *Celeste*; *Resetti*; and *Kicks*.

   
   
 * A fourteenth wave of ***Super Smash Bros. amiibo Figures*** was released in 2015 in Japan and included *Lucas*.

The game is called ***Yuma Will Burn***\-

***Yuma Will Burn*** *is an experimental narrative survival game where choices have long-lasting story and mechanical consequences. Harsh survival mechanics exist alongside a dynamically changing narrative in an uncaring and sadistic world of triage, poverty, and fear.*

(Only page up is Steam currently): [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma\_Will\_Burn/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma_Will_Burn/)

As a developer, I've taken a risk by dedicating so much time to a game of this type. The genre is VERY obscure and niche. I still did it though,  because I believe in both the artistic value of a deep and involving narrative experience and the unbridled passion some have for it.

The Switch store page will be up by release! In the meantime, consider wishlisting the game on Steam!",tyeishing,1,12,83,159,1055,0,0

zkj15q,Favorite Nintendo franchise revivals?,"I’ve been playing a lot of Punch Out Wii lately, and to say it’s a fantastic revival of a long dormant IP would be an understatement. I would put it up there with Killer Instinct, Mortal Kombat 9, and Strider 2014 as one of the best faithful reboots out there. Nintendo has revived plenty of dormant franchises over the years, starting as early as the GameCube release of Metroid Prime and Fusion and going all the way to today with Nintendo Switch Sports and Advance Wars (eventually… fingers crossed).

Looking back, Nintendo really went ham on reviving dormant IPs in the Wii era. Along with Punch Out, we got Sin and Punishment, Donkey Kong Country, Kirby, and Excitebike all within the span of 2 years.

I’m gonna quickly spotlight three franchise revivals that I enjoyed and helped elevate their respective series to the next level, two of which coincidentally being on 3DS. Let’s start with [Fire Emblem Awakening](https://youtu.be/n-BB3KbVUYI); this game came out in the wake of continuously declining sales of the franchise. The devs were given an ultimatum to have their next game sell well or else they’d be sleeping with the F-Zero developers. Needless to say it was a massive success, with four mainline entries, a successful mobile game, and a ton of spinoffs ever since.

Wario Land was a series that was defined by its surreal scenarios and handheld only nature,  as it made a name for itself on the Game Boy and GBA. But for seven years after Wario Land 4, we got nothing. Eventually Nintendo and developer Good Feel expressed a desire to revive the series for the Wii, and they did so with a striking hand drawn artstyle and a few anime cutscenes. This was [Wario Land Shake It](https://youtu.be/2r_AYT1FUYg), or The Shake Dimension in Europe, and… it unfortunately didn’t sell well at all. This meant that Wario would be stuck in the microgame factory while Good Feel continued to collaborate with Nintendo on other series like Kirby and Yoshi.

Finally we have to mention [Kid Icarus Uprising](https://youtu.be/WGR8wXl4QTM). After the first two 8 bit adventures, the series went dark for almost 20 years. But after Pit’s inclusion in Brawl, Masahiro Sakurai took it upon himself to revive the franchise on his own accord. And the result was one of the best games you could find on the 3DS. It’s an amazing blend of cinematic action, character writing, and content. And for a dead series of all things! Please just… play Uprising if you haven’t, especially if you enjoyed the characters’ banter in Smash’s Palutena Guidance conversations.",Asad_Farooqui,1,4,37,430,2557,0,0

I have played both Zelda BOTW and Mario odyssey and I understand that I am in no position to say they the best in their respective series as I have barely played the series.

zhygkz,anyone remember the Super Mario Super Show SNES give a way?,"I don't remember when exactly this happened but I'm guessing sometime in 1991. The super NES was just released and the super Mario super show had a live contest that ran for a month or two. At some point during the show they would scroll text saying to call this 1 800 number and win a free SNES.

Being from a poor background, I really wanted to win one. So I watched and called every weekday. The time to call was different each time. But when it appeared I would call. It would ring a few times and auto hanged up. So I would just try calling again and again.

Then about 3 weeks in... It happened guys... A lady answered. I asked if I won the SNES and she said yes. I started screaming to my older sister that I got threw. Then it AUTO HANGED UP! I didn't get crap. I kind of recalled the lady chuckling when she said yes .. like she knew it was gonna hang up on me. I was crushed.

So did anyone win a SNES? Was it all a scam to get ratings up? Such a mean thing to do to kids...

Please share any experience you had with this. If it helps I live in the US and don't know if the contest was held in other countries.

1. Mario (obviously)
2. Zelda (also obvious)

But what's the third?Pokémon? Sure it makes a lot of money but it's really divisive at this point

Animal Crossing? NH Sold way too much and it's basically mainstream now, I know many people who bought the switch just for AC:NH

Kirby? Forgotten Land was really good

Pikmin? Least likely, imo

Metroid? I don't think it's as big (I could be wrong)

Splatoon is popular but I don't want to include a multiplayer entry in the Big 3.

Mario Kart, Smash etc are crossover titles. Things like wario, Luigi's mansion, captain Toad, Donkey Kong, yoshi, Mario sports etc are spinoffs so They are disqualified.

Fire Emblem and Xenoblade are kinda Niche.

Star Fox and F-Zero are practically dead unless Nintendo revives them.

&#x200B;

I can't seem to be able to decide which would it be.For me, it's either

Mario, Zelda, Kirby

or

Mario, Zelda, Animal Crossing.

zhu5o3,Just purchased Link's Awakening yesterday..,"I held off on snagging Link's Awakening due to a massive backlog of games I needed to get through first. While I didn't play them all, I did make a serious dent and felt it was time so I snagged my copy yesterday evening.

I stated playing and immediately fell in love with the art style. I didn't think I was going to like it as much as I do but the performance of the game itself is shockingly terrible at times. I tried lowering my resolution as low as it would go thinking that might help but it did nothing. There are clear framerate drops every time I exit one location to another. It lasts only a few seconds but it's consistent. I hopped on Google to see about some kind of fix and was shocked to see people mentioning this in threads on forums 3 years ago. I hadn't heard anything about this issue. From what I could find from reading, apparently the engine is dropping from 60fps to 30fps due to memory limitation? 

While it doesn't render the game unplayable, I'm just a bit shocked that Nintendo would release this like it is, but more-so that they haven't addressed it with a patch of some kind after all these years. Plenty of games run at 30fps just fine so if it's a complicated bug fix or simply undo-able, why not release a menu toggle that locks the game to 30fps? It's not an ideal solution but the consistent jumping between the two framerates makes it feel like I purchased an unfinished game rather than the console selling title that the Zelda franchise is.",Mallion1,1,5,43,276,1482,0,0
zhw1sa,Why I think the Switch (probably) won't last 10 years on its own.,"Many Nintendo fans seem to have to stuck to the idea that the Switch will be our only Nintendo console until 2027. This is because Nintendo has said on multiple occasions that they plan on supporting it for a decade. I, personally, think there has been a huge misinterpretation here. I'll try and explain. Let's take the 3DS for example. The 3DS had a lifespan of 9 years. However, in its 6th year, the Switch was released. The 3DS was never considered ""dead"" when the Switch came out. Its discontinuation in 2020 marked the end of its lifespan. So, based on this, I'd say the switch won't be the only console between now and 2027. It would be unwise of Nintendo to release a console, immediately discontinue the switch and then have nothing to fall back on. So, they could release their next console, keep the Switch alive for a few years until it finds its footing, and then discontinue it when it's no longer needed. Or, alternatively, if their next console does badly, they could have the switch as a backup system. They've done this with every console they've released. 
That's my opinion on it, but what does everyone else think?",Nintentoad123,1,13,65,202,1135,0,0

zfy7yo,What does the Nintendo audience here think of gacha games?,"For the past 5 years or so, Nintendo has dabbled with the incredibly lucrative “gacha” business model. This has been a phenomenon that has permeated the games industry for well over a decade now, bolstered by such successful Japanese properties as Granblue Fantasy, Fate Grand Order, and most recently Genshin Impact. Other Japanese publishers like Square Enix and Bandai Namco have also taken notice and developed similar games to capitalize on this model.

Modeled after a Japanese toy capsule vending machine, a typical gacha game is usually free to play, but offers in app purchases for more chances to obtain rarer goods via a random roll of the dice. Nintendo has primarily done this with their mobile games, namely Fire Emblem Heroes (which was stupidly successful), Dragalia Lost (rest in peace), and Mario Kart Tour (which only just removed gacha a while back). But also they dabbled with gacha in their console games like Xenoblade Chronicles 2, as new Blades are obtained via this same system.

Gacha systems have frequently been compared to lootboxes in AAA western games like Star Wars Battlefront 2 and Overwatch. Certain governments around the world have even [recognized gacha games as a form of gambling](https://youtu.be/7ETC2OHGDhA) under the law and have taken measures to regulate them. But what do you think about them? Do you enjoy Nintendo’s handling of them? Or are they just more of the same thing in your eyes? Have you played any of the Nintendo games I mentioned that have them?",Asad_Farooqui,1,10,58,249,1507,0,0

zfq24x,"Been replaying Mario Sunshine lately, and there's one thing that bogs this game down for me big time.","Don't get me wrong; there's a lot to like about Sunshine. The entire concept of Mario going on vacation to a tropical island is actually pretty unique in the Mario canon. The graphics look amazing even 20 years later, and I would argue Mario's controls are the smoothest they've ever been in this game. 

But the thing that keeps me from wanting to play this game again? The blue coins. Dear god do those blue coins grind my gears. 

I have played through this game to 100% completion dozens of times, I still need to look up several locations, and mind you, this is with the modern luxury of being able to YouTube stuff instantly, back in 2002 you would need to buy a strategy guide. A lot of them are in places you would never in a million years think to look, like spraying an INCREDIBLY SPECIFIC part of a wall or spraying something for a long time. And the worst part is it's not just a few of them, there's several on each level that there's no way you'd be able to find without some kind of outside resource.

There's so much to enjoy about this game, but this mechanic seriously weighs down the replay value of the game. Anyone else have thoughts on this?",thehumanpopsicle,1,18,101,217,1163,0,0

 * ***Satoru Iwata*** was born in 1959 in Sapporo, Japan. A Japanese businessman, video game programmer and gamer. He was the fourth president and chief executive officer (CEO) of *Nintendo*.

Iwata expressed interest in video games from an early age and created his first simple game while in high school. In June 2014, a tumour in Iwata's bile duct was discovered during a routing physical exam. It was removed, and Iwata returned to work in October of that year. The problem resurfaced in 2015, and Iwata died at the age of 55 from its complications on July 11. Members of the gaming industry and fans alike offered tributes through public announcements and social media, and fans worldwide established temporary memorials. Iwata was posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards and the 2016 DICE Awards.

The original Japanese team who used to work on the Punch Out series now primarily does hardware, and Next Level Games has mainly been relegated to producing Mario spinoffs in the interim.

You may not realize this, but most of the Punch Out series is actually available now on Switch. There’s the arcade games via Arcade Archives, and the NES and Super Nintendo entries with a base online membership. Really we’re only missing the Wii entry and its Doc Louis side game.

zdl377,Star link should be the future of Star Fox,"Star link: battle for Atlas is a 6/10 videogame with a lot of problems, and it's also a great template for what to do with the future of the star fox franchise. Star link is a game with one major problem; it's suffering from a lack of content. If Nintendo actually gave Ubisoft Toronto a budget they might be able to make a really good game with the foundations of Star link.



Star link lacks content: this isn't a controversial take. In the game there are seven planet where you do the same 6 things. The game has a few different missions with base liberation/building, guarding a spot for a set amount of time, exploration, and puzzle solving. The biggest problem is there's so much of the same things to do that after a little while it all blends together, not to mention that three of the activities blend together with little in the way of variety. The ideas are great, but the problem lays in the fact that you have to do the same activities 280 times. In a real star fox game the solution to this problem is simple; add more content more missions, more variety in combat and introducing more gameplay options latter in the game to spice things up. More variety would go along way in things feeling less like doing a check list.



On a similar not the entire game lacks character and story. The crew of Star Fox is great but the story and other characters suck. You can have an amazing character but when they're trying to have conversations with drywall they are going to be lacking. Too many of the characters in star link had no personality. In a future Star Fox game I'd hope that they would make better side characters to give the cast more to work with in terms of backstory and lore.



Speaking of characters the lack of unique bosses and enemies really hurt the game. Most of the game lacks personality and with the lack of variety it creates a death spiral where you go to a planet and fight the same boring boss, then do the same boring boring missions where you talk to the same boring characters. Unique bosses and changing up the core gameplay loop is a must. Fighting the same bosses gets boring real fast. In a proper Star Fox game having more unique bosses that need different tactics to take them down would be a good first step in helping to freshen things up. After that maybe having to not fight the same bad guy the same way on every planet all the time would go a long way in not feeling the drag of doing the same thing with a change of wallpaper.



Star link gets a lot right the missions are good, the flying is fun, the weapons are all unique and offer real tangible benefits to using one offer the other. Where the game struggles is the lack of content outside of the combat and then spreading that content out over seven planets. Like I said, star link is a 6/10 videogame, but all the pieces are there to make a really good video game if the crew at Ubisoft Toronto are given a chance to reflect at what went wrong and fix the few problems that are there.",WorldlyDear,1,9,42,560,2995,0,0

zalf0i,Luigi's Mansion 3 began its development on the Wii U. What other Switch games do you think started development on the Wii U?,"The developers of Luigi's Mansion 3 confirmed in 2019 that the game started its development on the Wii U, before being moved to Switch. Obviously, the failure of the Wii U likely caused Nintendo to shift the game's platform early on.

There's no way Luigi's Mansion 3 was the only game that had this happen to it. This makes me wonder... what other Switch games were originally planned for Wii U?

I think Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an obvious candidate. The Wii U got an application called ""Animal Crossing Plaza"" in 2013, which had HD models of lots of Animal Crossing characters. Then in 2015, Amiibo Festival came out as a spin-off game. I think Amiibo Festival was likely created due to Nintendo delaying the next main series game to the NX/Switch, and so they rushed out a cheap spin-off game using HD assets they had already made.

Kirby Star Allies is another game I think may have been planned for the Wii U. The Wii U got a spin-off in Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, but it did not get a mainline traditional Kirby game. Star Allies was probably planned to release on Wii U, but moved to Switch and was released only 12 months after the Switch's launch.",pokeweeb3,1,23,124,211,1167,0,0

I’m too young (2003) and too non-American to witness DS era myself. I have never used Pictochat, flipchat, download play or Street plaza myself. All of them seems to be very social and evoking creativity, and that’s what im looking in gaming consoles. 

Playing Mario Kart or New super Mario Bros. DS with your friends via shared play, communicating with drawings, walking around with your DS in public place and founding out there are many DS users just like you (and even having their Mii arriving to your console) all this sounds like a LOT of fun.

Also DS had tons of good and unique games, and some of them are best entries in the series to this day (at least to my opinion). I think the current Nintendo approach should switch from single player Playstation-like focus to social and creative one. What do you think? If you witnessed DS era, was it like I’m imagining?

Basically King boo escapes in some way and instead of being bound to a mansion he can finally roam the world. Luigi and friends have to go on an adventure around the world visiting various kingdoms to find and stop him before he controls the world. 

The game can have many playable characters: 
Luigi
Mario
Wario

 * ***Nakayama Miho no Tokimeki High School*** was released in 1987 for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan. In this dating sim game, developed by *Square*, you have transferred to Tokimeki High School. You befriend a strange boy in class called Sadakichi who confesses he is a fan of teen idol Miho Nakayama and he gives you a phone number to her fan hotline. After class, you run into a girl in the corridor who drops a small mascot toy. When she comes back for it, you realise she bears a striking resemblance to Miho Nakayama herself.

   
   
 * ***Heisei Shin Onigashima: Kōhen*** was released in 1997 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this adventure game, developed by *Nintendo* with *Pax Softnica*, you play a series of side-stories to the Famicom adventure game *Famicom Mukashibanashi: Shin Onigashima*, telling the previously untold stories of Ringo the dog, Matsunosuke the monkey and Ohana the pheasant, as well as revealing the backstories of Donbe and Hikari when the Avatar of Darkness was awakened.

   
   
 * ***Heisei Shin Onigashima: Zenpen*** was released in 1997 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this adventure game, developed by *Nintendo* with *Pax Softnica*, you have to make your way through the game by moving to different screens, talking to the various characters and taking part in timed or action scenes in order to progress.

   
   
 * The ***64DD*** was released in 1999 in Japan. A magnetic disk drive peripheral for the Nintendo 64 developed by *Nintendo* with *Alps Electric*. It was originally announced in 1995, prior to the Nintendo 64's 1996 launch. The ""64"" references both the Nintendo 64 console and the 64 MB storage capacity of the disks, and ""DD"" is short for ""disk drive"" or ""dynamic drive"". New genres of games were developed due to the advent of 64DD's rewritable mass storage, real-time clock (RTC), and Internet appliance functionality. However, the system's commercial failure required many 64DD games to be released on traditional cartridges alone, ported to other consoles, or cancelled. Some of these standalone Nintendo 64 cartridge releases include the equivalent of the 64DD's RTC chip directly on board the cartridge, as with Japan's *Animal Forest*. The 4MB RAM Expansion Pak became a sometimes mandatory staple of Nintendo 64 game development, being packaged along with a few cartridge games. All subsequent Nintendo consoles would directly include RTC functionality.

   
   
 * ***Picross NP Vol. 5*** was released in 1999 for the Super Famicom in Japan. In this puzzle game, developed by *Jupiter*, a Character Mode features 12 puzzles based on *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time*. Each of the picture crossword puzzles is a grid with numbers along each row and column, representing a solid line that must be filled in. More than one number means there is at least one space between the lines.

   
   
 * ***Tottoko Hamtaro Nazo Nazo Q Kumonoue no Jou*** was released in 2005 for the Nintendo DS in Japan. In this quiz game, developed by *AlphaDream*, on the day Princess Hantena of the Hams is due to become queen, a mysterious group of Dark Hams descends from the clouds in a flying castle.The Riddle Q Team kidnap the princess and fly away. The Ham-Hams give chase in their balloon. You have to answer riddles on the touch screen by uncovering the answer on a word grid.

   
   
 * A second wave of ***The Legend of Zelda amiibo Figures*** was released in 2016 in Japan and included *Link - The Legend of Zelda*; *Link - Ocarina of Time*; *Toon Link - The Wind Waker* and *Toon Zelda - The Wind Waker*.

A lot of people are expecting a smash bros movie if nintendo continues to make movies about their IPs, but in my opinion, that would be a mess. Super smash bros has never shined because of campaigns, but it had 2 different stories, and both of them sucked, the first one had a lot of plotholes and the second one didn't even try. My guess is that since the roster is full of faces from Nintendo and videogames's history, it would be disrespectful if only some characters get the spotlight more than others, but when you don't have a focus for the story, what ends up happening is that you don't understand anything. Smash bros tried with subspace a story with no actual protagonist and that broke the fluency of the story, then they tried to make mini stories in the character reveal trailers were the newcomer was the focus and that worked, in fact, it worked so well that in ultimate they didn't even tried to make a story for world of light.
But obviously, Nintendo knows it would be a shame if their characters didn't cross up, so maybe they plan to make something else, and I have a theory about it.
I'm sure very few people know who Kevin Keene/Captain N is, this was Nintendo's very first attempt at a crossover, someone that appeared out of nowhere in Nintendo Power's magazines and then got a tv show and comic, said tv show sucked, but the comic is decent. Keeping in mind that Captain N is a Nintendo of America character, and in the end they are the ones who contact universal and therefore have more power than Nintendo of Japan when it comes to movies, maybe we will see Kevin get a redemption.

za4xro,My Charles Martinet Theory for new Mario movie:,"Ok so here’s my theory regarding why they’ve been so tight lipped about who Charles Martinet is playing in the Mario movie and why they’re no addressing any of the Chris Pratt voice complaints.  

Chris Pratt is playing Mario Jr., son of Mario Sr., voiced by Charles Martinet. 

I’ve got what I think is some pretty compelling evidence too, and I think this is going to be a huge part of the plot. I’ll get into the evidence as my general story layout unfolds. 

The story:
I believe the movie is going to open up with Bowser or one of his henchmen kidnapping Mario Sr. from our world. At this point, Mario Sr. is an old man who’s already been on dozens of adventures, namely all the games from the 80’s and 90’s. He’s too weak to fight back (not that this would matter since he’s been kidnapped loads of times even in good health,) but this would explain why Bowser in the first trailer is so convinced when he says “Now who’s going to stop me!” It’s because he’s already kidnapped Mario. 

We then cut to Mario and Luigi running their plumbing business in NYC when their dad goes missing. Mario finds a way into the mushroom kingdom through some weird magical plumbing system and discover soon that this is where Mario Sr is being held by Bowser. I think Luigi will probably stumble in on his own, or might even be collected separately by Bowser’s henchmen, thus why he seems clueless about everything. 

The majority of the movie will revolve around Mario uniting the Mushroom Kingdom and all his Allie’s to rescue Luigi and his father. That’s why we get Princess Peach looking like a warrior as well. They have a common goal to stop Bowser. For them, it’s about the Star, but for Mario it’s about his family. 

So that’s why Mario Sr. will be Charles Martinet. He’s going to be the immigrant 1980’s Mario. Mario Jr. will be Pratt, more New Yorker than Italian, having grown up in NYC. I don’t think it’s a stretch that Mario would name his kid Mario, after all, his name is Mario Mario anyway. 

TLDR: Martinet is going to be OG Mario, Pratt is OG Mario’s son.",mightyjor,1,8,47,377,2064,0,0

 * ***Excitebike*** was released in 1984 for the Family Computer in Japan. In this racing game, developed by *Nintendo*, the competition heats up fast! Face crazy curves, hairpin turns, and daredevil jumps as you race toward the chequered flag and the Excitebike championship. Race against the clock or challenge an opponent. You must keep your bearings as you fly through the air and avoid getting clipped by other racers. Stay cool under pressure, or your bike will overheat.

   
   
 * ***Kaettekita Mario Bros.*** was released in 1988 for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan. This platforming game, developed by *Nintendo EAD*, is a remake of Mario Bros.. In the late 80's, a food company called *Nagatanien* was producing ""Mario Curry"" for the Japanese market. The company sponsored this remake and their name appears throughout. Their sponsorship also meant the price of the game was lower than other *Disk System* titles.

   
   
 * ***Mr. Driller Drill Spirits*** was released in 2004 for the Nintendo DS in North America. In this puzzle game, developed by *Namco*, as the titular power-tooled miner, it's your job to dig through layer upon layer of colourful blocks, scramble for air capsules, dodge cave-ins and race to rescue fellow Drillers. Features precise Touch Screen control, three different game modes (Mission, Time Attack and the frantic Pressure mode), six playable characters and a wireless Driller Race mode for up to five people. You'll dig this game - literally!

   
   
 * ***Final Fantasy VI Advance*** was released in 2006 for the Game Boy Advance in Japan. In this role playing game remake of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System's *Final Fantasy III*, developed by *Tose*, the newly translated classic comes with improved graphics and sound - as well as a host of all-new features! True to form, the game is independent of other *Final Fantasy* episodes. However, players will encounter compelling similarities as they meet complex new characters with whom they will embark on spellbinding adventures.

z7y8bc,How many new-to-market consoles have you owned?,"I’m curious how many new Nintendo consoles (both home and portable) everyone here has owned. By this, I mean you purchased the console when it was new to the market (NOT years later when it was no longer in production and it had become “retro”). 
I’m sure many will have collected older consoles that existed before their time, or which they didn’t get new, but those don’t count… I’m wondering what consoles people owned when they were first on the market and why, and also why you may have skipped some consoles along the way.

Personally, I suppose my first new Nintendo console was the Donkey Kong Game and Watch handheld. My brother and I played that endlessly and I still have it.
In the early 80s, I also had a Commodore 64 and did plenty of home gaming on it, so we didn’t have an NES, but my friends and neighbors had the NES, which intrigued me enough that i got into other Nintendo games and saved up for an original Game Boy that I bought from the electronics and watches counter at K-Mart in 1989.
My roommate in college had an SNES that we played all the time and then we bought an N64 together. I also had gotten a Game Boy Advance and then a Game Cube around this time. 
I was really into the handhelds so I got a GBA SP too and then the DS right when they both came out.
I also got a Wii around this time and had many years of playing on it. 
I skipped some other consoles including the Wii-U and went for a long time without anything until I finally decided to get an OLED Switch.",MilwaukeeMax,1,7,47,287,1498,0,0

z8tynv,The 3DS is better than the Switch.,"Hear me out. In my opinion, as an owner of both, the 3DS has more great first party stuff than the Switch, and the third party offerings are more interesting in a lot of cases. Aside from BOTW, Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the Switch entries in a lot of storied franchises fell flat for me. Mario Golf for Switch sucks, Mario Kart 8 is inferior to 7 IMO and I didn't like the Switch Warioware or Smash Bros. entries at all. As far as updated repros go, we get very few on Switch. Link's Awakening is the standout and really there isn't a whole hell of a lot else. On 3DS there's 3D versions of Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask and Starfox 64.

As for third party stuff on Switch, we have a bunch of indie stuff of varying quality (getting to App Store levels of oversaturation tho) and anemic, buggy as hell ports of stuff like No Man's Sky and X-Com 2. The third party stuff on 3DS includes some really cool things, like Sega's amazing 3D ports of their classic superscaler games from the 80s. For my money, there's just more to play on 3DS.",megadriver187,1,7,34,203,1075,0,0

z7ue3z,"What do people here think of Dragalia Lost, probably Nintendo’s most successful new IP since Splatoon?","I completely understand if you didn’t know about this game or just don’t care. This was Nintendo’s fourth major attempt at breaking into the mobile game market after Super Mario Run, Fire Emblem Heroes, and Animal Crossing Pocket Camp. And it was pretty successful for itself, grossing over $167 million dollars in revenue and at one point being the company’s second biggest mobile success after Fire Emblem.

[Dragalia Lost](https://youtu.be/nb6H3EivKcc) was an action RPG co-developed with Cygames, the Japanese company probably best known for creating the hit mobile game Granblue Fantasy. It’s a similar high-fantasy setting with tons of kingdoms, dragons, swords and sorcery, the whole kit and caboodle. And it’s a gacha game too, so you had to summon dragons and characters with resources you gathered in game or by buying them outright with real money. There were even a few special collaboration events with Mega Man, Monster Hunter, Persona 5, and Fire Emblem. It should come as no surprise that this game took off the way it did, just like Fire Emblem Heroes before it.

It was apparently one of the more forgiving gacha games people have experienced with how generously it handled its in-game currency, and it’s cultivated a passionate fanbase over the years. But the main reason I’m bringing this up today is that…. as of this writing, the game set to officially shut down tomorrow after an impressive 4 years of service. For being a brand new IP going toe-to-toe with some of Nintendo’s top dawgs, this game did really well for itself. Rest in peace little guy, you did good.",Asad_Farooqui,1,16,102,265,1588,0,0

z6yijl,Pokemon SV are actually really good!,"Hey guys! This sub has been melting down over Pokemon SV's percevied lack of quality. But I've personally really enjoyed them so far, I've gotten 4 badges and done 3 Starfall Streets/Titans and I have to say that these are the best, most enjoyable Pokemon games I've ever played. Yes there are performance issues, but really the occasional frame rate drop isn't that big of a deal to me. 

The main thing I like is the open world, I've always been more focused on catching them all and Pokemon SV makes it easy to wonder around and look for new Pokemon (new Pokemon whose designs I think are really good for the most part), walking around and seeing the Pokemon in their habitats feels way more immersive then running around having to get in like 20 encounters to make sure I've got everything.

I'm also a fan of EXP candies. I remember *hating* having to grind in SoulSilver and Diamond to beat the E4, it was annoying, slow and did not make me have a closer bond to my Pokemon. Now I can just do some Tera raids and boom, now I'm at the level I want. The music is also great too.

z59vm0,Nintendo games with the best DLC offerings in your opinion?,"Over the course of the last decade, beginning with the 3DS and Wii U era, Nintendo has finally gotten into the game of offering new content post launch. And while stuff like the modern Mario sports games may spur your opinion on Nintendo with DLC, truth be told they have offered some of the finest quality DLC we’ve seen in the modern gaming landscape. Here are four big first party games (besides Smash and Mario Kart obviously) that I feel do paid DLC incredibly well in no particular order.

**1. [Xenoblade Chronicles 2](https://youtu.be/6kMHFFpZfX0):** Probably the single best season pass Nintendo has ever put out, and it just goes to show which of their development subsidiaries is truly superior to the rest. Xenoblade 2’s expansion pass includes new Blades and Blade quests, new costumes, a new Challenge Mode with its own unique set of rewards, and most important an entire prequel campaign in Torna: The Golden Country. I spent over 110 hours in the base game and just under 20 hours in Torna, and the latter was everything I wanted Breath of the Wild’s story DLC to be. And that gut punch of an ending hoo boy.

**2. [Pokemon Sword and Shield](https://youtu.be/bKD_nASppNk):** The Pokemon Company is finally embracing a more modern content delivery. Goodbye third versions, direct sequels and expanded re-releases, and hello paid DLC! Okay to be real for a sec, the launch period of this game was rough, but to many people this DLC actually saved the game for them. I never played the games myself to form a definitive opinion on them, but that’s the general vibe I got from the reception.

**3. [Fire Emblem Awakening](https://youtu.be/8kTawTYxWlc):** This was supposed to be Fire Emblem’s last gasp before dying a slow and painful death…. but thankfully it wasn’t. And with its unprecedented success came large amounts of paid DLC maps. There are maps for farming experience and money, maps for obtaining rare weapons and classes, maps for recruiting legacy FE characters into your party, and finally story focused maps that expand on the world of the base game. What I especially like about these DLC maps is that they don’t necessarily detract from the main adventure like how Fates and Echoes did. You can just pick and choose which ones you want to get; you didn’t need to buy it all. I mean I did because of course.

**4. [Mario Golf World Tour](https://youtu.be/dm2K7lkZxqI):** This is one that I especially want to call attention to, as it is way more important to the history of Nintendo’s DLC practices than you may realize. Mario Golf World Tour’s DLC lineup is hugely important because it was the very first time Nintendo had ever done a season pass…. ever. This actually scared quite a lot of people back in early 2014, as Nintendo and season passes didn’t really have any history with each other, but it did get people talking about potential DLC for the upcoming Mario Kart 8 and Smash 4. As for the DLC itself, it was actually fantastic! It added 4 new characters, 6 new golf courses, tons of Mii costumes, and over 100 extra challenges for the in-game challenge mode. It’s all great stuff. What happened Camelot?",Asad_Farooqui,1,10,59,537,3144,0,0

1. Forces you to buy another product that should be a standard feature.
2. Creates enormous amounts of e-waste
3. Makes the user rely on the functionality of the Switch to charge the joy-cons.

Im incredibly saddened that Nintendo has chosen this path for their products where now I feel they are becoming the new EA of the gaming industry, adding to climate change and degrading the quality of experience this fan has come to expect. I can understand as a cost saving measure, that a charge port on a critical component might not get much use, but this creates so many potential frustrating situations for users the only explanation for this design choice was to increase sales and was in fact approved by Nintendo executives themselves.",SexyDoorDasherDude,1,16,108,160,903,0,0

 * ***Donkey Kong Country: Blockbuster World Video Game Championship II*** was released in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America. In this platformer game, developed by *Rare*, a few select levels return from *Donkey Kong Country* with the addition of a point counter and a few minor tweaks to encourage scoring, the goal being to score as many points as possible.

 * ***Killer Instinct Gold*** was released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64 in North America.

z3k0rj,The Unexpected Outcome of requesting a refund,"Like many others, I have found the technical issues with the new Pokemon to be too aggravating, distracting, and frankly insulting to ignore.

So I requested a refund for my digital purchase, hearing that they sometimes make exceptions to their no refund policy.

I was told no. So, I asked again, expressing my disappointment, that the game is in an unacceptable state to the extent that it feels insulting, and that, as a lifelong Nintendo fan, I don't feel as inclined to buy from a company I feel disrespected by in the future.

So they said they would escalate the request to the relevant department.

Great, it looks like we're getting somewhere! After all, I've Ioved Nintendo my whole life, nobody actually wants to stop buying their games over something like this.

Another email: We have a strict no refund policy. Please try restarting your system, reinstalling the game, changing your micro SD card; time wasting stuff that we all know won't work. The rep apologises for my problems with Pokemon Violet. I had bought Scarlet. Maybe they didn't read my previous emails?

So I restate how I feel. Only this time, something unexpected happens. I feel more like I mean it. Might I actually never buy a product from Nintendo again over this? If they insist on disrespecting their customers? If that good will is worth the £50? If they really want to attach their reputation to this game?

A new email. ""We are sorry, but we are unable to provide a different decision, your comments have been passed on to the relevant departments.""

So, it's really no.

When I first said I may not buy from Nintendo again, I wasn't expecting to end up meaning it. I felt insulted with the condition of the game, insulted by their refusal to refund it, by their time wasting suggested ""fixes,"" but the most insulting part? They dont give a damn what I do next. They have my money now, and that's that. 

So, will I be buying from Nintendo in the future? Nobody cares, really, least of all Nintendo. I can do what I want. And after this, though I never thought I'd say it, I actually just don't want to give them any more of my money.

So I won't.",cheddleberry,1,7,45,381,2136,0,0

z1p43g,Completed the game - A balanced review from a game developer,"Pokémon Violet  


Context: I am a AAA game developer with nearly 20 years experience in the games industry making some of the biggest games on the planet, and as such feel I have a pretty stable viewpoint of this polarising games reception.

I have put in around 40 hours since Friday and rolled credits last night. Now I will start with the tech issues and negatives before we end on a VERY high note. The game is technically a garbage pile in terms of code and stability. I know I know, it's Pokemon so it brings joy and warmth but it's a very buggy mess with constant rolling memory leaks which can easily be replicated. Graphical glitches regularly break immersion, and here is an overview of ones I got on a regular basis:

* NPC's walking through cutscenes and just standing inside other characters while they talk
* NPC's faces coming off and floating around the screen
* Frame rates constantly sub-24 - This is not a point of WAAA NOT 60FPS OMG, this is a level of frame rate that triggers nausea and vomiting in a lot of players as the instability causes motion sickness. This is a known pitfall in development and you should ALWAYS prevent a game from rolling under 24FPS, with wild fluctuations as quite simply put, your audience will literally vomit
* LoD priorities are essentially none. LoD (load on demand) is the feature that games use to prioritise loading of assets and tech on screen to avoid overloading your buffers and crashing/dropping performance. This game has essentially 0 LoD priority setup so the game is just wild on what you can and can't see/interact with at any one time
* Lighting/shadows is abysmal at times in that in some areas you will feel like you are under a spotlight, and others you wont see a thing. Shadows are heavily broken too and often load as paint splodges with heavy pixelation
* Crashes are constant and easily replicateable. The main one is while playing online, you have a roughly 1 in 5 chance of crashing when entering the Sandwich shops or restaurants
* Body horror rigging issues across the board where NPC's and playable characters are contorted and twisted in horrific shapes because their animation rigging is poorly built and not optimised at all. To give you some insight into this, every movement is applied to a rig (a skeleton) for an NPC or character, and that rig decides on how the animations are limited in terms of ""can a knee bend backwards"" etc. When animations get added to different places they still reference the same rig they were built on, and if that rig changes, the animations referencing it can go insane if not checked and QA'd
* Models and textures not loading or only loading super low res variants even in cinematics
* Various other smaller glitches and bugs that destroy immersion

So that's the tech side, and I cannot say anything other than the tech is garbage. If this was a game of the year contender (it isn't right now) this would be the part that made it an instant no on deciding that as technically the game fails on nearly every front. This is an OBJECTIVE (factual) view of the tech, not SUBJECTIVE (opinion/emotional).

Now onto the games music. It slaps. It's great at multiple points and constantly feels like a bop. There was only one point (which covers roughly 7 hours of gameplay too) where it needed addressing and that's doing the lessons in the school. You get the same loop played over and over and within a few minutes I hated that track because it felt like I was being drowned in the same few bars of music. Contrast to that the final act music pieces including the final encounters are awesome, but slightly less epic than things like the final encounter with Necrozma in Sun/Moon, Eternatus in Sw/Sh and Dialga in Legends: Arceus. Can't really fault any of the music other than the lessons bit above, top tier stuff here.

Right, so that brings us to the games storyline. Oof. OOOOF.

It starts out with you being the same old 10 year old only now you are in PokéSpain, but instead of being sent down a pretty linear path, you get the keys to the open world and are told to go explore it, which for the most part you do. I did find the open progression frustrating at points as without level scaling or any notification of level requirements, I found myself doing encounters that WAY over or under levelled me. Simple map markers suggesting level ranges or even adding level scaling would solve this. Anyways, I digress. The storyline is AWESOME! It ramps up through 3 sub stories, all with impact and a great ending feeling like you have really done some good to this world and they culminate in unlocking Act 4 which has been teased throughout by leaving a big blue splodge in the centre of the map, and do I mean BIG. You build up to understanding there is something bad happening in the crater and the professor has been preparing you to travel into the space to help them (him or her depending on your game version). You get a great ramp up into descending the crater and are then greeted with what I can only describe as the Great Plateau in terms of size and scale of a new zone which has great music, ambience and constant danger as you descend into the Sci-fi madness of the ending, and the ending WAY outshines all previous Pokémon games, and subjectively I would say beats a lot of JRPG's too. I had to take a moment on completion to contemplate all the stuff the game threw at me in the final act and it would be here where the Game of the Year contender would come back into play. The ending goes HARD and the build up is meaty, wonderful and mostly without over the top exposition. Like every conversation has meaning and impact and it was just glorious, opening the door to massive endgame and huge potential for more to come in DLC.

The character design is beautiful, and while the game does flow a tonne of them at you, each one has cool and well explained backstory and beautiful art styles, the standout for me being the red lady (who's name escapes me) from Team Star with the massive boots and bizarre walking animation. Seconded is the Electric Gym Leader who on reveal I thought looked horribly irritating and twee, but when I interacted and did that section I thoroughly enjoyed it.

So here it is, the game being in it's current state is not a contender for anything other than average rewards but if they fix the tech issues to a level where your immersion is unaffected, we definitely have the best Pokémon game in the mainline series. Objectively the game is terribly made and clearly was made for higher performing hardware but subjectively, it's a AAA gold bar.

Enjoy and hope you enjoyed reading my review.",J-3D1,1,11,60,1197,6657,0,0

 * ***Fusajiro Yamauchi*** was born in 1859. A Japanese entrepreneur who founded the company that is now known as *Nintendo*. Yamauchi lived in Kyoto, Japan and had a wife and a daughter, Tei Yamauchi (who later married future *Nintendo* president and Fusajiro Yamauchi's successor, Sekiryo Kaneda). On November 6, 1889, Fusajiro Yamauchi opened the first ""Hanafuda"" (flower cards) card shop called ""*Nintendo Koppai*"" during a time when the Japanese government was banning playing cards from the hands of the public, due to them being tied to gambling, with the exception of Yamauchi's playing cards. With the huge success he had in selling these cards, he rapidly began expanding and opened another card shop in Osaka. He later went on to create more cards. Fusajiro departed from the company in 1929, leaving his son-in-law Sekiryo Kaneda (whose name had changed to Sekiryo Yamauchi) in charge of the company. In the next eleven years Fusajiro remained out of the business until he had a stroke, which led to his death on January 1, 1940.

The core audience is young children that play games like Roblox, Fortnite, Minecraft etc. As fans grow up, and their tastes change, they often resent Game Freak for continuing to make games with weak graphics and immediately assume its laziness and not a design choice. Little kids love Pokémon. The fact that you don’t like the game could mean that game freak sucks, or it could mean that your tastes changed. If you don’t like the game, don’t buy it. I’m just tired of everyone assuming they know better than GF and Nintendo. “They are so lazy”.

z0mtpl,I find Xenoblade more appealing to me than Zelda. Can anyone empathize?,"Weird question? Probably yeah, but I find it interesting to bring up. I think I have a unique perspective when it comes to these two specific franchises. I didn’t really branch out to other Nintendo franchises until the Wii U era, and I mainly bought that console for Smash. I saw Shulk’s moveset with the Monado arts and thought it was super cool and fun to play, so I wanted to find out more about this character. That’s how I stumbled into the Xenoblade series, and I finally got to play the first game when it came out on the Wii U Virtual Console. After falling in love with that, I followed the Xenoblade series up to the present day, owning every entry in some form.

I didn’t get into Zelda until the Switch era, and my first proper jump into the franchise was with Breath of the Wild. I adored the open world gameplay of both it and Xenoblade, and that makes sense given that Monolith Soft helped out massively on this game. But now I’m afraid I colored my perception of the Zelda series by starting with Breath of the Wild. I don’t find the “traditional” Zelda formula to be all that appealing; going through dungeons in a fixed order with a super basic adventure story that I don’t feel is “epic” enough to warrant copious amounts of cutscenes and dialogue.

I can appreciate certain characters in a vacuum (Midna is awesome), but I think I gravitate more towards “gameplay driven” experiences with Zelda because it has such a basic narrative. This would explain why my very next Zelda game was A Link Between Worlds on 3DS, which I absolutely adored and didn’t feel like my time was wasted. And that’s because it gave me a feeling of freedom similar to that of Breath of the Wild, and I may just like it slightly more.

So I think I’ve gotten my point across as to what I look for in Zelda. Maybe I’m looking at the series with the wrong expectations, and I don’t doubt that the previous traditional entries have their merits. But I guess when I want an epic adventure, I want something bigger in scope. Can anyone empathize with me here? Or am I the weird one?",Asad_Farooqui,1,12,71,382,2073,0,0

They really did just tell you what you needed to know and then let you go do whatever you want. And that's exactly what a Pokémon game should do. I ignore the map completely so I can just explore everything in the game, and then I just happen upon the main quest items as I go. On top of that, the new Pokémon introduced have been some of my favorites. The sense of adventure i am getting from this game is precisely the thing that got me hooked on the franchise back in red/blue as a child. In other words, it has everything I could ask from the game, and I am fully satisfied with my purchase.

z09nyn,Idgaf about the bugs/framerate of the new Pokemon because I can finally play with my friends.,"I'm not ignoring how comical these bugs/framerates are, they are funny at most, but I truly don't give a damn about any of it because I'm having so much fun. I stopped playing on Sun/Moon because I got bored and didn't like the removal of gyms. 

I had no expectations of anything from this game, as I didn't read up on it or spoil anything and I am having a fucking blast. Is it archaic looking, sure, but I am still having fun. Non of it is game breaking. What really kicks it into gear for me is being able to explore with friends. This is something I've been wanting for far too long and I really hope this is a feature that will stay in future games. 

I'm not trying to say anyone is wrong for being upset by making this post, but I am making this for those who don't care about those or who are also really enjoying it so far. My only advice to those who hate it, is to get a refund and go back to playing another Pokemon game that you love.

The stain this horrible studio is leaving in the Nintendo's family is growing year after year (I know they don't own the majority of GF but Nintendo has made everything to relate the IP to the brand so idc for that statement).

We are at the point that even Call of Duty is a more respected name than Pokémon in the industry and has delivered better products this year than Game Freak has done in the entire console's life; you know what? even before that. Trust me, if this game was made by someone like Ubisoft or Sonic Team you wouldn't be hesitant AT ALL to bitch both the developers AND the publisher.

I won't be surprised AT ALL if the next generation ends up being a Cyberpunk/Fallout 76 level of disaster and Pokémon fans still show they are at FIFA/Madden followers level of conformism.

yzz1kz,How do you think Nintendo should handle a more powerful Switch?,"With the clear technical limitations the Switch has been experiencing since the beginning and the problem becoming more and more apparent over the years with Scarlet and Violet reigniting the call for a more powerful switch, what way do you think Nintendo should go about it?

Considering how much the Switch is BEHIND other consoles at this point a HUGE leap needs to be taken to have it be able to somewhat compete with new systems.

Here's a couple of ways I've thought of that they can help mitigate this huge gap in power but feel free to leave your thoughts or shoot other ideas!

・The sacrifice route.

Because of the huge gap in power and how difficult and expensive it would be to make a powerful dual system, Nintendo decides to make another model for the Switch that's the opposite of the Lite.

This model is dock only but has roughly the same power as an Xbox One for like 350-400$

This makes developing games for the Switch WAAAYYY easier but likely leads to a lot of exclusive releases.

・The ""New"" 3DS route.

Make a slightly more powerful Switch model that's still a dual system and sell with the others.

・The full update route.

Nintendo releases a decently more powerful Switch that replaces all the original and oled models and retires them.

It's the same price as the original just a decent bit more powerful but nothing special.


Overall these are the main ways I can think of Nintendo doing for a more powerful Switch.

Personally I'm heavily leaning towards a way more powerful but docked only model.

That way all the restrictions on battery life come off and we can see games alot better optimized.

While the models that are portable can be weaker, but this feels like fair compromise to me tbh. 

Trading power for portability but giving people the option for seems like a good idea to me.

Imagine New Switch games with all that power

I’ve noticed that lately on both my PS and xSX, I’ll just play a game for the trophies or achievements and then stop playing if I either get platinum, or if the trophies end up being too difficult. I’ve been gaming for 17 years, and the switch is the closest experience to how I used to play in the GameCube days back in 2005. I played a game for fun, not to just grind it out for meaningless stats, and I think that’s the problem with those kinds of things.

yypmzq,What if Nintendo started porting their games to PC?,"We have all heard the speculation about a more power Nintendo Switch pretty much since the day it was released. The “Switch Pro” and now the “Switch 2”. While I have no doubt a follow up is on its way in the next couple years there is a reason this has been such a popular topic since the Switch launched. It’s simple. The Switch doesn’t live up to the standard of other home consoles.

Nintendo marketed their new “hybrid” as a home console. However, in terms of its technical makeup and performance the Switch is a handheld that you can dock and play on your TV. This is why its never quite lived up to other consoles when you blow it up on your 4K television. It also explains why there have been talks of a more powerful Switch since day one. There is demand from the enthusiast gaming community to play games like Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey at 4K 60FPS. 

Nintendo will bring out a more powerful Switch in the next couple years and with help from NVida and technologies like DLSS there with certainly be a generation leap when compared to the current Switch, but it will undoubtedly still leave some enthusiasts wanting more. Much like the current Switch launching in the middle of last generation as a 1080p console up against 4K updates from its competitors, Switch 2 will likely be similar place when compared to Series X and PS5. How can Nintendo avoid constantly disappointing this enthusiast part of the market? 

This is where I think Nintendo could make a lot of money while quenching the thirst for an enthusiast Nintendo experience. Microsoft and Sony are showing that the PC market is not a market that will necessarily threaten your core business. If Nintendo went the Sony route and tried porting some games to PC a year after launch I think they would find similar success.  That would undoubtedly lead to a second wave of sales.

I think from a PR perspective it would also help Nintendo not having their handheld Switch console constantly compared to much more powerful hardware. The enthusiast crowd could have their console experience with Nintendo games via PC and Nintendo could continue to target one platform for their game development. PC versions would just be ports handled by outside studios, not a target platform for Nintendo when creating the games for Switch. It’s something Nintendo has already explored with some of its third part partners. Think of what Capcom did with Monster Hunter Rise.

I think that would work beautifully for Nintendo and it would go a long way to combat some of the piracy and emulation they despise. They could even make their own launcher and offer their Nintendo Switch Online service on PC. I know many will laugh at the idea, but there are a lot of consumers that would rather buy a legitimate product than download ROMS and emulators. 

Imagine some of Nintendo’s big multiplayer games having a foothold on PC and everything that would come with that. I think Nintendo’s eSports presence could be massive for games like Mario Kart, Smash and Splatoon. Cross-play would be a must.

Anyways, just me shooting the shit. It will probably won’t happen any time soon, but I wouldn’t rule it out. NVida and Nintendo are working together after all and if Sony shows that they can do it in a way that doesn’t hurt their console business Nintendo will have to seriously consider it.",Cardamander,1,9,51,588,3356,0,0

The Joycons themselves are honestly pretty good controllers, they’re not outright terrible but I also don’t think it’s the best way to game. But hey, buttons are fine, they fit in my hands well, playing detached mode is honestly pretty awesome, etc… but geez the drift just makes me absolutely hate these Joycons and I don’t understand why it’s so apparent.




I’ve gone through 2 Joycsons and 2 fixes in the past 2 years… THE PAST 2 YEARS!!!!! When my first Joycons weren’t working I figured it was no big deal and sent them to Nintendo since I knew it was free, perhaps Nintendo would stop the drift from happening altogether. WRONG… just in 2 months I’m experiencing hardcore drift on the right analog stick, so the camera in the game would just nonstop move and it was impossible to play.





I decided to just get brand new Joycons and figured mine were just faulty. I had hope as it had been six months since no drifting but sure enough it started happening again. However, it was minimal so I just let it go but it progressively got worse in the matter of 2 weeks and on top of that the other Joycon started drifting?! So again I sent them in and not even 4 months and it’s already having issues.




But this point I just raged and just stopped playing Switch altogether and just started focusing on watching movies or going out, or other gaming needs like PC. See I don’t wanna leave Nintendo, but man this drift is bad. I also started looking into it and realized this was an overall big issue with everyone and it shocks me how 5 years later Nintendo has never revised the Joycons :(. 



Even worse is I’m the type of guy who doesn’t like 3rd Party stuff cause I usually wanna support the company or am satisfied with the official hardware, but holy moly for the first time in my life I’m considering buying 3rd Party Joycons and an Adapter to use my PS5 controller on the Switch when docked… that’s how bad it has gotten cause it’s clear as day that Nintendo isn’t going to fix this soon.



I take very good care of my things, my Xbox One controller from 2012 works beautifully still today and I was playing Arkham Knight (in honor of Kevin Conroy May he rest in peace) and no drift or anything. This is a controller I also used a lot especially on shooters and still nothing.




Yet on a Joycon, it’s like the slightest wear happens and it’s game over, I treat my Joycons with so much care and no aggression yet I’m met with drift in just months. 




I’ve never been so frustrated with a controller in my life, and when I say games are unplayable I absolutely mean it. Camera moving non stop then my character on top of that can’t stop moving? Ooooof.",hushpolocaps69,1,18,95,561,3050,0,0

yyenwp,On This Day in Nintendo History: VS. Ice Climber; Pocket Bomberman; Metroid Fusion; Mario Party 6; Super Mario Strikers and more,"#On this day (November 18) in Nintendo history...
   
   
 * ***VS. Ice Climber*** was released in 1988 for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan. This platformer game, developed by *Nintendo*, is a port of the arcade game with 24 new mountains and extra features, such as a horizontally-flying Nitpicker and a bonus multiplier item.

   
   
 * ***Pocket Bomberman*** was released in 1998 for the Game Boy Color in North America. In this platform game, developed by *Hudson Soft*, in contrast to the overhead view of other *Bomberman* titles, *Pocket Bomberman* features sidescrolling platformer gameplay. Like other *Bomberman* games, Bomberman must defeat all enemies in each stage to advance. The game features a total of 5 worlds spanning 25 levels. Each world follows a different theme, including forest, underwater, cloudtops and a dark underworld.

   
   
 * ***Metroid Fusion*** was released in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance in North America. In this action-adventure game, developed by *Nintendo R&D1*, while on a mission to the Metroids' home planet, bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by a deadly parasite. Cured by Metroid DNA, Samus is bestowed with unique new powers from her old adversary, but must face a new enemy: the 'X' parasite. *Metroid Fusion* blends a captivating original story with intense platform action and exploration in the classic *Metroid* mould.

   
   
 * ***Mario Party 6*** was released in 2004 for the Nintendo GameCube in Japan. In this party game, developed by *Hudson Soft*, Mario, Luigi, and the whole gang are back - which means it's time for a brand new party! This latest instalment of the ever-popular series packs over 75 all-new mini-games, five multiplayer game boards and three solo game boards to play across - and a Nintendo GameCube Microphone, essential for those new games! The boards and mini-games differ depending on the new day and night system.

   
   
 * ***Mario Smash Football*** (known as ***Super Mario Strikers*** in North America) was released in 2005 for the Nintendo GameCube in PAL territories. In this sports game, developed by *Next Level Games*, following successful stints on the tennis court and the golf course, now Mario turns his hand (well, foot) to the world of soccer. Sees Mario's phenomenal ball-skills brought to the fore as he demonstrates a starling range of unorthodox shimmies and swerves.

   
   
 * ***Fossil Fighters: Champions*** was released in 2010 for the Nintendo DS in Japan. In this role-playing game, developed by *Nintendo SPD* with *Red Entertainment*, *M2* and *Artdink*, Fossil Fighters from all over the world gather at Fossil Park on Caliosteo Island, established by the world-famous Joe Wildwest, to revive dinosaur fossils and battle eachother. However, a gang known as the Barebones Brigade are plotting to take control of Caliosteo Island and have been causing trouble for the Fossil Fighters. Adds new dinosaurs and prehistoric beasts to revive.

yy26er,Buyer Beware: Nintendo Canada (+USA?) charges return shipping on defective product exchanges,"I ordered 2 N64 controllers and one was defective (broken button). I initiated an exchange and got an e-mail saying I had to pay shipping for the return. Initiated another chat and they said yes that's their standard procedure on exchanges and returns. I had to call in a third time and escalate to a manager to get them to send me a return label. And even then, they said they only were doing it because they neglected to mention to me in the exchange chat that I had to pay for shipping. 

I can't think of a more anti-consumer treatment than to charge your customers to send back faulty products. Just a word of warning to anyone thinking of buying products directly from Nintendo.",GrimTheReaper,1,12,92,125,684,0,0
yy0v7o,"Bayonetta 3 is a good example of ""tripping at the very last""... in more than one way. (Spoiler-ish for Bayonetta 3)","I loved what Nintendo brought this year on the Switch. Between Pokemon Legends Arceus, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Splatoon 3 and Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, it was a really satisfying year overall... but then Bayonetta 3 came and... oh dear...

I loved almost my entire time with that game, it was an immensely fun game with a ton to like. But then the ending came (and for ending I mean everything after I defeated the final boss, that one was great as well) and it was one of the most atrocious things I've ever seen in gaming really. 

Bayonetta is not a game you play for the story, but for the gameplay, and on that front it was a perfect game.  But seriously, the ending of the game was so terrible that it soured a lot not only my whole experience with an otherwise great game but also the whole 2022 of Nintendo to me, and I feel it Nintendo tripped at the very last because of it... 

Maybe it's just the fact that I've never been in a situation like this before, but that's how I feel...",,1,21,115,194,1028,0,0
yxxw1v,Is it time for a next-gen switch?,"So I want to start this off saying that I love my switch! Still using the one from my original midnight launch! The games Nintendo has made are incredible, but after trying out Pokemon Violet a bit early I think it's time to finally announce a next gen switch. 

The game is fun and one of my favorite Pokemon titles ever, in terms of gameplay. But in performance it's really heartbreaking. It barely hits 1080p 30fps, NPCs and Pokemon will pop in when 20 feet on front of me, and when they are more than 5 feet away they move around at like 10fps, main NPCs look great in cutscenes, but the other NPCs and world textures are almost GameCube era.

I'm not asking the switch to rival my 3080. That's not going to happen, but with systems like the steam deck running new AAA games fine, and also being able to emulate switch games, it just seems like it's time. The new switch doesn't have to run RDR2 at 4k, but I think it should at least rival the steamdeck. For Nintendo titles that is an easy 1080p 60fps, with room for more immersive performance.

I just think it's time",SirNichlaus,1,7,33,201,1073,0,0

yxqtco,Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime are now 20 years old! What do you think about these massively acclaimed entries in the longrunning series?,"Feeling old yet? Yes today is indeed the 20th anniversary of both Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime, two entries in the Metroid franchise that are highly regarded in the eyes of critics and fans. After 8 years of silence following the release of Super Metroid, we finally got a return in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance and GameCube. Fusion brought the 2D series back into the spotlight and narratively continued off from Super, and Prime brought the franchise into 3D for the very first time and became one of *the* reasons to own a GameCube.

[Metroid Fusion](https://youtu.be/ORJnXhI1dBM) was the brainchild of series co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto, who wanted to implement more story elements into the Metroid series. And he accomplished this through specially curated setpieces and a more terrifying atmosphere thanks to a new threat: the SA-X. Metroid Prime on the other hand has a more complicated history regarding developer Retro Studios, so I recommend checking out [this video](https://youtu.be/tuc8X9qKePo) for more details.

Fusion has been re-released exactly twice: once on the Wii U Virtual Console and once as part of the 10 GBA games included with the 3DS Ambassador Program. Prime has seen a few more re-releases: once in Japan as part of the New Play Control line, again along with its two sequels as part of the Metroid Prime Trilogy compilation, and finally the Trilogy version as part of the Wii U Virtual Console. So if you own a Wii U and are interested at all in checking out the series, these are worth picking up!",Asad_Farooqui,1,23,139,257,1534,0,0
yxkexl,On This Day in Nintendo History: Star Wars: Rogue Squadron; Donkey Kong Country; Metroid Prime; Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga; Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and more!,"#On this day (November 17) in Nintendo history...

   
   
 * ***Star Wars: Rogue Squadron*** was released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64 in North America. In this action/shooter game, developed by *Factor 5* with *LucasArts*, after the first Death Star was blown to pieces at the battle of Yavin, young Luke Skywalker formed Rogue Squadron from the remaining energetic group of dedicated Rebel pilots. Along with Wedge Antilles, Luke logged 16 missions against the Empire before the Imperial invasion of Hoth ended that portion of his career.

   
   
 * ***Donkey Kong Country*** was released in 2000 for the Game Boy Color in PAL territories. In this platformer game, developed by *Rare*, it's a jungle in there... Now, thanks to Game Boy Color and Rare's expertise, the original creators of *Donkey Kong Country* have crammed the entire Super NES version into a Game Boy Color cartridge without scaling down any of the classic levels or changing the play.

   
   
 * ***Metroid Prime*** was released in 2002 for the Nintendo GameCube in North America. In this action-adventure game, developed by *Retro Studios*, the Space Pirates may be up to their old tricks but Metroid-hunter Samus Aran has a new look on life. For the first time, you'll see through Samus' eyes as she embarks on a whole new adventure - continuing the gripping story that has spanned three generations of Nintendo systems. This eagerly-awaited fourth chapter begins in true *Metroid* style - as Samus' ship docks at a derelict spaceship.

   
   
 * ***Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga*** was released in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance in North America. In this role-playing game, developed by *AlphaDream*, the Mario Bros. team up in this hilarious action-packed game. When an evil witch steals Princess Peach's voice, Mario and Luigi must venture beyond the Mushroom Kingdom to a mysterious new world packed with surprises! Take control of both brothers as you explore the vast lands of the Beanbean Kingdom, encountering wacky characters and bizarre new enemies.

   
   
 * ***Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team*** was released in 2005 for the Game Boy Advance in Japan. In this roguelike game, developed by *Chunsoft*, you've caught them, you've trained them and you've battled them - but now you can find out what it's actually like to be a Pokémon! You wake up in a world inhabited entirely by Pokémon, as a Pokémon yourself, with no knowledge of how you got there or how you can return to human form. But perhaps there's a reason for your arrival.

   
   
 * ***Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Mystery Team*** was released in 2005 for the Nintendo DS in Japan. IN this roguelike game, developed by *Chunsoft*, now that you understand the Pokémon language, you learn that a series of natural disasters is threatening the community. You soon befriend another Pokémon and form a Rescue Team to help Pokémon in distress. You receive missions to rescue Pokémon trapped in dangerous dungeons, which are always randomly generated (mean that you'll never play the same dungeon twice).

Admittedly this is probably due in no small part to the fact that I grew up with DS and have played it far more, but when I've tried playing 64 at my friend's house or in other contexts I always have a really tough time of it. It feels like I'm trying to control butter in a pan while in DS the controls are much more precise and easy to use, even with just a D-pad.

yxb1d6,"Warning: Nintendo will not send refunds, exchanges, or replacements for defective items purchased from My Nintendo Rewards","Just a warning to anyone ordering any items from the My Nintendo Rewards portion of the store, it is not possible to get any items replaced, exchanged, or refunded!

In July of this year I used my platinum points to order a Mario Strikers: Battle League drawstring bag. I have been using the bag since then, and recently one of the seams completely came undone, making the bag unusable. The bag is only four months old at this point so I called Nintendo support to see what could be done. I was told that the only option I had was to simply use more points and pay another $6.99 in shipping to order another bag. The customer service representative told me that the warranty for this item is for just *30 days* after the item is received. When I told him that it seemed like the item is defective given that the entire seam gave out, I was told that the item was not defective and that my understanding of how long the item would be usable was incorrect on my part. I was also informed that because it is a My Nintendo Reward item, they could not issue a refund, could not send me a replacement bag, and could not do an exchange. I was then told that if I wanted to continue to use the bag, I would need to have it repaired on my own dime.

I have looked around the entire Nintendo website and can not find anywhere spelling out that this is the policy. Next time you are ordering one of these items, consider the fact that Nintendo considers these items to have useable lifetime of just 30 days.",BlazePlaysRetroGames,1,17,122,284,1496,0,0

 * ***Faxanadu*** was released in 1987 for the Family Computer in Japan. In this action role-playing game, developed by *Hudson Soft* with *Nihom Falcom*, you are an adventurer who has just returned to his home town, the Elf town of Eolis, at the base of the World Tree. You find the village in peril - the Elven water supply has dried up, monsters are causing chaos and the tree itself, once proud, is slowly wilting.

   
   
 * The ***Pokémon mini*** was released in 2001 in Japan. A handheld video game console that was designed and manufactured by *Nintendo* and themed around the *Pokémon* media franchise. It is the smallest game system with interchangeable cartridges ever produced by Nintendo, weighing just under 71 grams. The systems were released in three colours: Wooper Blue, Chikorita Green, and Smoochum Purple. Features of the *Pokémon mini* include an internal real-time clock, an infrared port used to facilitate multiplayer gaming, a reed switch for detecting shakes, and a motor used to implement force feedback. *Pokémon Channel* features playable emulated demo versions of *Pokémon mini* games, including the console exclusive *Snorlax's Lunch Time*. Various hackers have reverse engineered the *Pokémon mini* (with the aid of the aforementioned emulator in *Pokémon Channel*) in order to enable the creation of homebrew games, and to allow official games to be played on other platforms (such as a PC, Dreamcast and various others).

   
   
 * ***Pokémon Party mini*** was released in 2001 for the Pokémon mini in Japan. In this minigame compilation, developed by *Denyusha*, the sun is out, the drinks are chilled and the trophies are twinkling on the winner's podium. The Pokémon are having a Sports Day party and you're invited. Are you up to the challenge? Featuring seven stunning games packed into a Game Pak the size of a postage stamp, *Pokémon Party mini* will give you a big buzz - literally. Best of all, the Pokémon have given you an open invitation.

   
   
 * ***Pokémon Pinball mini*** was released in 2001 for the Pokémon mini in Japan. In this pinball game, developed by *Jupiter*, the timeless thrills of pinball combine with the irresistible world of Pokémon - a superb miniature title that will hook you from the very first play. Diglett, the cherry-nosed ground-based Pokémon, has agreed to lend his services as the game's sole ""flipper"". A Pokéball acts as the pinball, and using the A button you can use Diglett's head to nudge the ball towards bumpers, holes, and other targets. It's tougher than it looks.

   
   
 * ***Pokémon Puzzle Collection*** was released in 2001 for the Pokémon mini in Japan. In this puzzle game, developed by *Jupiter*, this little piece of plastic contains a colossal 80 stages of Pokémon action - and there's a prize Pokémon rewarded for each brainteaser you complete! Plus, you can keep track of your creature-collecting progress at any time by accessing the built-in Minidex. The 80 puzzles are divided into four brain-busting types, with 20 games apiece, and in steadily increasing difficulty.

   
   
 * ***Pokémon Zany Cards*** was released in 2001 for the Pokémon mini in Japan. In this strategy game, developed by *Denyusha*, a leisurely-paced game, ideal for the more relaxed player - although you may not stay calm if that dastardly Meowth beats your hand of cards time and time again! Four classic card games are brought to virual life, with brilliantly-animated Pokémon characters acting as opponents and helpers. In Wild Match, trump your opponents by making combinations from the cards dealt to you and those on the table.

   
   
 * ***Master of Illusion*** (known in Europe as ***Magic Made Fun: Perform Tricks That Will Amaze Your Friends***) was released in 2006 for the Nintendo DS in Japan. In this non-game, developed by *Tenyo* with *8ing*, you will have the power to perform mind-boggling magic tricks in no time! The fun starts when you walk through the door of Great Barbara's magic shop - your first stop on a journey of discovery that will teach you how to use your DS as an assistant for your own private magic shows.

g3ptch,Giveaway for a Nintendo Switch Lite and your choice of game! [US/CA only],"**Winner(s) posted at the bottom edit!**

Hi everyone, hope everyone is safe and well. As rough as these past several weeks/months have been on all of us, I'm also constantly inspired by all of the amazing acts and words of kindness that I've seen not only in my own, personal social circle, but the world at large as well.

I would like to do my part, and I'm giving away a brand new Nintendo Switch Lite and your choice of a single game to one lucky winner!

To enter, leave a comment on something positive, however small, that happened to you in the past month. The winner will be randomly selected in 24 hours, at 12 pm Sunday, April 19th EST.

I can only ship to USA or Canada, and the game must be available for purchase on Amazon for $60 or less, either as a physical copy or digital e-shop code.

Good luck, and enjoy your weekend in whatever capacity you can!

Edit: I'm genuinely trying to read all of these/as many as I can. These are all wonderful stories and moments. Thanks for sharing.

Edit: If anyone is looking for a pick me up, I'd encourage you to spend 5-10 minutes reading through some of the comments (as well as leaving your own comment). Start a conversation with a stranger. Make someone else's day :)

**Edit:**

**I am overwhelmed by all of the moments and stories that were shared on this post. I’ve spent the better part of the past 24 hours (minus sleeping) reading, commenting, and chatting with complete strangers. I have gone through thousands of comments, and it has absolutely made my weekend! I wish I could have read everyone’s comment, but I never expected this to blow up the way it did.**

**While everyone’s story/comment was of course different in some way, there were some very prevalent themes throughout the comments: family, friends, love, community, reconnections, learning, and of course happiness. I hope everyone is able to hold on to whatever is helping get them through this pandemic. I handpicked a few of my favorites from what I read if anyone else is interested.**

glzq99,Fun Fact: The entire N64 international library (388 games) could easily fit on a 32GB Nintendo Switch game card.,"And here's the math to back that fact up.

The maximum recorded storage capacity of a Nintendo 64 cartridge is 64MB.

If we assume the absolute extreme scenario of every N64 game being **64MB,** then multiplying that by the **388** unique titles in the international library, you come to a grand total of **24.83GB.**

But, remember; the true total is far less in reality. For that, you'd have to scour for the exact file sizes of each game and them up to a more accurate grand total, and that's something I don't have the resources for at this time.

So, yeah, food for thought. Can you imagine the full N64 library on a Switch? A pipe dream, to be sure, but since we'll probably never see the N64 Mini, this would be a license to print money.

When I started, I didn't know much about making a video game, but I learned the necessary skills as time went on. It was my dream to make a modern game in the tradition of the SNES and PS1 Harvest Moon games. After Stardew Valley launched for PC, it quickly became a global success. At that point, I sought the help of my publisher, Chucklefish, for porting and localising the game. 

With the help of Sickhead Games, we've brought Stardew Valley to Mac, Linux, Xbox, PS4, and most recently the Nintendo Switch!

 It's really cool to see Stardew on a Nintendo platform... I was obsessed with my SNES and N64 as a boy, and nintendo will always have a special place in my heart.

I look forward to answering your questions!

5oxke7,Reddit helped my brother get a special visit to Nintendo to play Zelda. Here's the end of the story.,"A few months ago in October, I made [a post on /r/Nintendo some might remember](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/58bidw/trying_to_get_in_touch_with_nintendo_for_my/) about my younger brother and his wishes to play Zelda: Breath of the Wild. He was 26 at the time, and due to the life long effects of a congenital heart defect (CHD) his body was beginning to completely shut down. He was worried that he would not make it to the game’s release date, and so I turned to Reddit to see if I could make something happen for him. When I originally made the post, I tried to keep low expectations in regards to what could be done. I could not have imagined the incredible response it got, and the joy my brother felt as I read him the wonderful replies from people. It blew my mind when I was actually contacted by Nintendo, and we were quickly able to set up a visit for a couple weeks later.

Unfortunately, I had to fly back to NYC and was unable to stay longer and be with him for the experience, but he and my mom filled me in on all the details. Since they had a photographer, I wanted to wait to make this post until we [received their photos so that I could share them](http://imgur.com/a/fD8NO). He got a tour of the facilities (he was really into the conference rooms, lol), lunch with staff, a bunch of goodies (including a Zelda backpack, signed poster, 3D shadow box), and he got to sit down and play an early build of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I just keep pulling up this photo of him playing the game and looking at his face, knowing the difficult life that he had and the magic that video games were to him, the deep joy he got from exploring other worlds. It was an unforgettable day for him, and the Nintendo staff was incredibly kind and supportive. I have to throw out huge thanks to Kate, Ken, Hana, Gil, and many others at Nintendo for doing this for Gabe.

Sadly, on January 14th, a few weeks after his 27th birthday, Gabe suddenly but peacefully passed away. I am still at that point where I feel like I am in some sort of bizarro alternate dream universe where my brother is just missing, but I’ll wake up any moment and he’ll be calling me to tell me about some new video game. It still astonishes me that he fought so hard to stay on this planet for as long as he did, because it was a true battle for him everyday. Many born with CHDs don’t make it out of their teens. Getting to share his story and maybe bring some awareness to his condition as well is all I can hope for at this point.

Everything happened so fast with the first post, I honestly don’t even know who to specifically thank on this sub for making this happen. I’ll just thank every person who gave an upvote, left a kind reply, or just read our story. It’s been a a difficult and emotional year, but there was a lot of joy in there as well. Gabe was not given nearly as much time on this planet as he deserved, but I am going to think about him every single day for the rest of my life, and I know there are so many other people who will do the same. This entire experience was unforgettable, my mom and I will cherish these memories forever.

Edit: Someone suggested that since this post is getting a lot of visibility, I promote the [Children's Heart Research Guild](https://www.childrensheartresearchguild.org/). My mother actually helped to start this non-profit in 2008 to bring awareness about CHDs and raise funds for research through Children's Hospital in Seattle, Washington. Gabe spent a lot of time in Children's Hospital as a child, I remember wandering the halls as a young boy while he underwent various procedures. Thank you to everyone for the kind replies and encouragement, this is obviously a difficult time for my family but the support we've gotten from this community as well as Nintendo has been nothing short of magical. Gabe may be gone from this earth, but he will never be forgotten.",jaimage,1,19,100,709,3911,0,0

But I noticed an odd name towards the beginning of the credits (not spoilers since it's just credits), it was an English name. Now normally those are reserved for the translation section of any Nintendo game but this one was for programming.

Now you're probably thinking none of this actually interesting, ""Sure it's not unlikely that some non-Japanese guy works at Nintendo"" and you're right it isn't but the interesting part is after doing a quick google search, I found this on the first page.

The amount of monetary and gift donations I've been offered is overwhelming, but I'm not going to take anyone's gifts. Instead, consider making a donation to Parkinson's or Alzheimer's research. Or just buy yourself a big pizza tonight.

- To those of you who think I'm making all of this up in order to get karma: I'm gonna fill my bathtub with all my stolen karma and bathe in it.
- To those of you who think I'm making all of this up in order to get Nintendo to patch the game: It'd be nice, but I doubt it'll happen. If Nintendo patches in the ability to disable motion controls, it won't be because of me.
- To those of you who are going through my years of post history to catch me in a lie (yes, some of you did): You do you.
- To those of you trying to convince me that motion controls are optional, they're *not* optional for someone with hands that rattle around like a blender.
- To those of you who think I don't have my priorities straight: Yep.
- To those of you who think people on disability shouldn't be allowed to buy video games: I'm allowed to have a fucking hobby.
- To those of you offering me kind gifts: Thank you so much, but I have to decline.
- To those of you suggesting I get a third party wired controller with no gyroscope: I already have a Gamecube controller, and I totally forgot that there was recently an update that allowed me to use them. Thank you!

#Thank you everyone for your support, and kind words!

I'm so upset right now that I can barely think straight.

I want to start off by saying that I suffer from Parkinson's disease, as well as crippling depression and anxiety. I live on disability which gives me just barely enough money to live off of. After rent, food, and utilities, I usually get to keep *maybe* $50 CAD assuming there aren't any other unforeseen expenses and I use all my coupons. I was able to get a Nintendo Switch by saving money from the day it was announced to the day it released, at a sizable cost to my quality of life. I went hungry a few nights because I knew that Breath of the Wild was going to be something special, and it truly was.

Fast forward to Halloween, I did it again. I saved up for a couple months to spend on Super Mario Odyssey. For those of you who don't know, the prices of games in Canada have astronomically skyrocketed in the last five to ten years. What used to cost around $60, now costs nearly $100 when you factor in tax. Super Mario Odyssey cost me around $92. My monthly disability income after I pay rent is about $400. After food, bills, etc there's not a lot left.

It'd all be worth it though, once I got to finally play this game that was getting 10/10s across the board. I kept hearing things like ""Greatest Mario game of all time"", ""Game of the year"", and ""Better than Breath of the Wild"". I immediately fell in love with Cappy, and the cool spooky hat world. Finally a Mario game that's more than just Ice World, Fire World, Grassy 1-1 World. It didn't take long for my heart to sink.

By now you might have figured out what my biggest complaint is: mandatory motion control. People have already tried to tell me ""Oh, but it's not really needed to beat the game"" or ""You can do all of the moves with hidden button combinations"". Sure, you might not need to flick your remote to throw Cappy, but you DO need to flick your remote to do Cappy's homing attack, arguably the most useful attack in the game. And maybe it is possible to beat the game without use of motion controls, but is it possible to get all the moons? Is it possible to *not* throw Cappy every three seconds when your hands shake like a fucking washing machine on spin cycle? Even with motion controls set to the minimum sensitivity, it's just not possible. Naturally the ""disable motion controls"" option does jack shit, and only disables motion controls for the tanks and binoculars.

I grinned and just accepted it. I'd hold my hands as still as I could so as not to send Mario and Cappy into a spinning tossing fit. The last straw was during the first 8-bit section. I love classic Mario. I spent forever playing Mario Maker, and seeing 8-bit stages painted in the walls like Link Between Worlds was a treat. Did you know that flicking the remote makes Mario jump in this mode? I broke down crying because I just could not control the game. I've beaten all three Dark Souls games, including the secret ""Fuck you"" bosses, but I couldn't beat the first few worlds of this children's game that was so dear to me.

The next day, I called Nintendo's customer support to plead them for a refund, explaining my situation. The guy on the line just seemed appalled at my audacity of trying to get a refund on a digital purchase. $90 is a huge amount of money for me. It's basically a quarter of my monthly income. It kills me that I can't play this otherwise amazing game, and it kills me that Nintendo gets to get away with bullshit because they're Nintendo. There's no way in Hell Nintendo is going to realize ""Hey, maybe motion controls aren't fun for everyone"" over the roaring applause of the reviews.

Thank you for anyone who listened to me.

Edit: You guys are awesome. I feel better and am going to try finding a controller without gyroscopes.

**Edit 2: Holy shit this blew up! To all the amazing people offering to buy me a gyro-free controller, thank you so much! I'd rather you make a small donation to Parkinsons or Alzheimers research instead. I already have a gamecube adapter, and I totally forgot about the recent update. Thank you all so much for the kind words!**

###Edit 3: Seriously I have enough donation offers to buy like 2 more Nintendo Switches! I'm *not* going to accept any donations though. I already have a gamecube adapter. I'm all set now! :) ",Thopterthallid,1,17,94,1075,5790,0,0

And so, [armed with a list of all ~1250 games published by Nintendo](https://pastebin.com/wNus3Cb4), we began the arduous process of whittling that down to 256 entrants into a single-elimination tournament: the ONLY fair, scientifically-accurate, and non-controversial method of determining which single title could be considered the greatest of all time.

https://preview.redd.it/c3ek1c3238y31.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e874a56a5cad65c379a6cd241b7a94d52916c7e7

There were some highs, like EarthBound's underdog journey against Animal Crossing New Leaf, Fire Emblem Awakening and Xenoblade Chronicles to make the Top 8. And there were some lows, like when Yoshi's Island got eliminated in Round 1 or when Pocket Monsters' Stadium - a Japanese-exclusive precursor to Pokémon Stadium which only had 42 Pokémon, no minigames or Gym Leader's Tower - SOMEHOW advanced over Donkey Kong Land III, Nintendogs: Lab & Friends, SimCity and Electroplankton.

But in the end we all learnt that any negative reactions to the results was wrong and that the votes aren't just a reflection on a limited demographic of subreddit subscribers but a legally binding and exclusive proclamation that will reverberate throughout the universe. These votes will surely be studied in the generations to help in the ongoing war to eliminate wrong-think.

AND it was fun, too!

|Bracket|Winner|Percentage|Loser|Percentage|Abstain|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Finals|The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild|52.5%|Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door|45.5%|2%|

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild successfully fought off Yo-kai Watch 2: Psychic Spectors; Yoshi; Steel Diver; Face Pilot: Fly with your Nintendo DSi Camera!; Bayonetta; Gold Cliff; Animal Crossing Plaza; Tin Star; The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Wii U); The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds; Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition; The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD; The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time; Super Smash Bros. Melee; Pokémon SoulSilver Edition; and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door on its journey to the top. 

Congatulations, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild!

So, what's next?

So, the spirit of Tuesday Tussle is to do an exhaustive all-encompassing tournament. It's pretty delightful to pit Super Mario World up against Nintendo DSi Metronome. But I don't want to do this game tournament again, at least not until our 20th anniversary, and while the dream next step would be to do the best Nintendo Character of all time, I'm not sure if I could cope with months of ""It's not fair to put Link, which is 19 characters, against Doshin the Giant which is one."" We're rapidly approaching the end of the year, now, so in January we'll be in full swing for our Game of the Year as well as Game of the Decade awards.

So, I'm going to pencil in the next Tuesday Tussle in for around March. And I'd like a series of future tournaments to last no more than two months. So that means we'll do an entire round of 128 brackets in a week if we have to to keep it on track. I'd really love to hear your suggestions for improvement, and ideas for what we can do next. Some rough guidelines:

* Should be a topic we can reasonably construct an exhaustive list of
* That exhaustive list ideally would be close to 64, 128 or 256 entries. I mean, that would be nice, but not mandatory.
* Let's keep it as close to Nintendo games and not just generic games as possible

And some ideas that I'm looking at doing:

* Best Mario Kart track
* Best Zelda Dungeon
* Best Villager in Animal Crossing (but, I mean, that's Ketchup the Duck, obviously)

ighvin,Mario Party may have the single most disappointing evolution/growth as a gaming series than any other Nintendo project. Unpopular Opinion?,"Some may argue that the lack of growth in the development and playstyle of Pokemon over a quarter century is Nintendo's big disappointment, but Pokemon is a massive game with an insurmountable level of complexity.  Yes I feel like pokemon has underachieved with what they could deliver, but i also acknowledge the sheer mostronsity of what that project might entail.

Mario Party on the other hand.... is relatively incredibly simple in both concept and design.  Yet year after year after year, the games just seem to get worse and worse and worse.  They have become so uninspiring and devoid of any reasonable element of strategy and skill that you might as well just be sitting around a cardboad box rolling dice to see who rolls highest.

1 led to 2 which led to 3, which seemed like they were at the very least developing an ongoing growing system.  But It seems as if, since then, the main goal of each new version is simply to apply some sort of new superficial gimmick, and never is the goal to build upon the core successes of previous iterations.  Where's the map creator?  Where's the customized bonus rules?  Where's the collection of good/fun games from all the previous entries?  I feel like the implements to make a great and forever beloved Mario Party game are right there, most of them are already created, just scattered throughout the games.  So easy to apply them, but nope... we just get these completely uninspiring abominations.

It's dumbfounding to play these games and think that this is supposed to be an improving process.  In some versions, coins literally have no value, because everyone has tons of them all the time, shops sell 3 random weak/cheap items, and the stars cost so little that they are basically freely obtainable.  The game then boils down to who gets luckiest with rolls.  Oh what challenging fun.

Is it truly Nintendo's decision to not give us the Mario party we've always wanted, so that they can continue selling cheap/shitty/boring/rng based iterations every two years.

Sorry, rant over.  This is a game I like to play with old friends, and we just can't believe that after like 20 years we still are choosing Mario Party 3 because the other ones are sub-par, most being significantly worse.

ngj9uy,"Why Nintendo games never go down in price, directly from Satoru Iwata","In the book Ask Iwata, Satoru Iwata is quoted as having said:

> After a piece of hardware is released, the price is gradually reduced for five years until demand has run its course. But since the demand cycle never fails, why bother reducing the price this way? My personal take on the situation is that if you lower the price over time, the manufacturer is conditioning the customer to wait for a better deal, something I've always thought to be a strange approach. Of course, this doesn't mean that I'm against lowering prices entirely, but I've always wanted to avoid a situation where the first people to step up and support us feel punished for paying top dollar, grumbling, ""I guess this is the price I pay for being first in line.""

While the fact that Nintendo games rarely go down in price is a major complaint from Nintendo fans, many the *number one* complaint, I think what he says here makes a lot of sense. It sucks being an early adopter and then having someone who waited get it for cheaper, and it makes business sense to try to discourage waiting for a sale.

A few months ago, out of boredom and partially anger at the lack of any sort of curation on the Switch's eShop, I set out on a quest to play every single Switch game in an attempt to find the hidden gems.

j239e7,"I own two copies of one of the rarest Nintendo consoles, one of which is signed by Miyamoto himself.","Just like the title says, and I swear I've got plenty of proof for this.

A bit of background first though: I religiously play a Japanese made mobile puzzle rpg called Puzzle and Dragons, I've played this for about 7 years now. Back in 2015, the company (Gungho) partnered with Nintendo to make a 3DS version called Puzzle and Dragons X + Puzzle and Dragons Mario edition, I'm sure some of you have heard of this and saw the release.

Well, Gungho released a tournament for this game where you submit a score, and top 12 scores compete in LA for a chance to win a trip to Japan. I placed 9th in the former, so me and my mother flew down to LA so I could compete. At the LA competition, I placed 3rd, and top four won the trip. So early 2016, my mother and I flew to Japan this time, and I competed in the Puzzle and Dragons International Tournament along with three other Americans. Side note, we all got absolutely crushed. I think we were all out by the second round.

Regardless, the prize just for making it was a custom made 3DS with the date and name of the tournament. Along with that, they actually gave us 2. One was standard, and I actually used that as my 3DS for awhile. The other though, was signed by Shigeru Miyamoto himself (pictures will be below).

I'm not looking to sell these by any means, and not necessarily bragging either, I just think this is super neat and I don't think a lot of people know about it. I'm pretty sure there's less than 100 of these consoles that exist, so the fact I posses two is fascinating. I'm bringing this up now because a friend of mine sent me this video ""[Nintendo's Rarest Consoles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy0hZ2JZDfw&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR1Ug9LEcVJvA8iHyoOvora_SdM6P3-5B2lpwOuTT-ASaHM4PCD7tsd7OMo)"", and if you skip to 9:45, there's a rundown of the event and the 3DS consoles. Also, if you watch until 11:10, there's actually a clip from the LA tournament, and that dweeby 15 year old kid in the rock paper scissors shirt is yours truly. (I really wore that on a livestream, ouch).

But anyways, here's proof:

opfmdy,There is no reason why Game Boy Family systems are not on the Nintendo Switch Online Service.,"With the recent backlash against the games Nintendo picked for this update, it raises a serious question as to why the Game Boy Family is not on the Switch Online Service yet.

I get that Nintendo can only put up games that they can get the rights too and since many of the major third-party franchises like Mega Man and Castlevania already have collections, this limits Nintendo's choices.

So...  Why are they sticking with digging out the closeout bin at a Blockbuster for their online service games?   Why not just add the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games?

If they add one or two games a month and maybe toss in the odd NES or SNES game, they could extend the life of the service and have titles that people would pay money to play.

Let's look at an example, suppose this was an update.

Metroid Fusion(Game Boy Advance)

Mole Mania(Game Boy)

Claymates(SNES)

Clearly, Metroid Fusion would be the big hitter in this lineup and the title that gets everyone excited.    Mole Maina is a lesser known Game Boy game from Nintendo, but a good game and it would get a brand new audience as would Claymates which would avoid alot of the backlash its getting now from angry Switch owners.

This is also assuming that Nintendo put out games every month.  If they do their current strategy of releasing games ever couple of months, they could extend this lineup even further, basically through the rest of the Switch's lifespan.

I just don't get it.  Why is Nintendo not taking the obvious solution here and adding Game Boy Family systems to the Switch Online?    I don't believe for a second that any of those systems, even the GBA are hard systems to emulate, they have games people want to play like Fire Emblem, Metroid, Zelda, Mario, etc.

I expected them to add the Game Boy Family to the Switch Online at e3 and nothing happened.  

Hell, it would even give them tons of cross promotion.  Metroid Dread launches this year, could you imagine the promotion Nintendo could run by saying that you can catch up on the 2-D Metroid games with Switch Online and pointing out that they have all the games before Dread(Metroid/Zero Mission, Metroid II, Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion)

It boggles my mind that Nintendo is letting what should be one of the strongest parts of the Switch Online Service become its weakness.

Nintendo, you sit on nearly 40 years of gaming history, use it.  Maybe you can't put N64 or Gamecube games up yet, but there is no reason why in 2021 there are no Game Boy Family systems on the Switch Online.

Its a portable system, so is even more natural to add these games.   But instead, you're digging the bottom of the clearance bin for games and so ashamed of your picks, you're not even Tweeting them out anymore.",Caryslan,1,17,93,488,2757,0,0

I write this post because I was very shocked to find out how bad the situation at Nintendo of Russia is.

Here is my translation of what former Nintendo of Russia employees say about Yasha Haddaji and the working conditions at NoR.

If anyone wants to read the full article (using google translate, for example), you can do it here: [https://gameguru.ru/articles/v\_rossyskom\_ofise\_nintendo\_unijayut\_lyudey\_chto\_proishodit/view.html](https://gameguru.ru/articles/v_rossyskom_ofise_nintendo_unijayut_lyudey_chto_proishodit/view.html)

&#x200B;

\* He screams at people regularly using a combination of russian and english curse words and he does so aggressively - after all meetings the girls are crying in a bathroom.

&#x200B;

\* Yasha pays you more if you don't care about Nintendo at all. ""The less f\*#s you give, the more you get paid"".

&#x200B;

\* He tells girls what they should and shouldn't wear in the office or during the meetings with clients. ""Wear that leather skirt, he will sign everything"".

&#x200B;

\* Speaking about harassment - he told one girl to call him ""Papa Yasha"". Some girls said he ""touched their butt"", tried to make them sit on his laps and more stuff like that.

&#x200B;

\* He hires people with absolutely no experience - PR is done by people who know nothing about, the same can be said about marketing, logistics and sales.

&#x200B;

\* He's inadequate when it comes to planning events - 90% of time during meetings he discusses a design of plastic bags and only 10% are spent on talking about budget and organizing. And if an event won't happen at all after that - it is a fault of a guy designing the plastic bag.

&#x200B;

\* He has connections in most HR agencies and all of the former employees are added to ""the black list"". He badmouthes people who left the company 3-4 years ago, talks with their new employers and tries to make them fire people who left NoR.

&#x200B;

\* He doesn't care for people's privacy, he could easily read all of your private messages on social media and then tells everybody else all your feelings and what troubles you.

&#x200B;

\* Everyone is scared to talk about what really is going on at NoR because of Yasha's connections. His favourite way of letting people go can be summed up in the classic phrase ""You're not breaking up with me, I'm breaking up with you!"", i.e. when people try to leave the company, according to russian laws they must work there for 2 more weeks. During this time he picks on you and screams ""YOU ARE FIRED!"".

&#x200B;

\* ""Just so everyone understands how scared everybody is - when I walked on heels, my colleagues asked me to change my shoes because it sounded a lot like Yasha's"".

&#x200B;

\* If Yasha knows about your insecurities, he secludes you and tries to make other people gang up on you or laugh behind your back.

&#x200B;

As you can tell already, that's pretty messed up. I really hope that this guy will be released from his duties and the company hires someone with passion for Nintendo products.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Yasha Haddaji doesn't respect his own employees and treats them badly. He shouldn't be the CEO of Nintendo of Russia. I hope that Nintendo of Europe listens to us and finds a new CEO, who is passionate enough to do this job.",dor-yaboh,1,8,47,573,3380,0,0

a8vev8,"Masahiro Sakurai did not leave HAL after ""getting tired of sequels"". Here is the real reason he left HAL.","Hello everyone. This is something I wanted to show months ago but choose not to until Sakurai himself made it more clear making sequels was not the reason he left HAL since I didn't want to feel like I was jumping to conclusions. Luckily, I saw in an interview on Nintendoeverythings website today Sakurai made it clear he did not leave HAL laboratories because he was tired of making Kirby games. Which can be seen [here](https://nintendoeverything.com/sakurai-clarifies-why-he-left-hal-laboratory-doesnt-feel-stuck-in-a-rut-doing-similar-things/). I decided to re-find the FULL original interview of where Sakurai said *""It was tough for me to see that every time I made a new game, people automatically assumed that a sequel was coming.""*. I eventually found it on ""Kirby's Rainbow Resort"" which was translated by video-fenky from a Nintendo Dreams magazine in 2003. Which can be seen [here](http://www.kirbysrainbowresort.net/info/kirby101/kirbycreator.html). It was odd because I was seeing NO ONE and NO SITE mention the rest of the interview when talking about when Sakurai left, with Sakurai even saying in the newer interview how the reason for why people think he left HAL has been ""twisted"". So I've decided to post the original interview and interpret why Sakurai actually left HAL.

**The full interview from the site about Sakurai leaving HAL is below which all comes from Sakurai:**

>*""It was tough for me to see that every time I made a new game, people automatically assumed that a sequel was coming. Even if it's a sequel, lots of people have to give their all to make a game, but some people think the sequel process happens naturally.""*  
>  
>*""With times as they are, it's really difficult to make any money for yourself, and I know that I'm taking a big risk here. It's entirely possible that I could just fade right away without ever seeing the light of day again. But even if that happened, I've already decided to myself that I should keep on doing the work I can do, even if it's not all about games.""*  
>  
>*""When I look across the entire game industry, I think we're at a point where we can't get away with being lazy. The game industry is in big trouble, don't you think? Not a lot of people can survive off game sales these days, and the possibilities that games have to offer are growing smaller and smaller, I think. If games were able to receive a certain amount of support-if people had fun with them, if they sold well-then we should be seeing more innovative, more positive games come out one after the other. But that's not the future I'm seeing right now. The risks are so big that misfiring with one title can flatten an entire company.*  
>  
>*That's why you see places trying to stay alive by putting out tons of budget titles and re-releases. Every game company, no matter who they are, is desperate right now. So one possibility is that people will say 'I can't live off this anymore' and leave the game industry in droves. You see a lot of people use terms like 'console wars' and compare the whole thing to a fight for territory. You \[the interviewer\] and lots of other people in the game industry get termed 'Nintendo people' or 'Some other console's people' by someone you've never even met. But this is no time for that, I don't think.""*  
>  
>*""If I want to keep producing games as a business, then staying at HAL would be a more stable place to do that. HAL has its advantages. I get a reasonable amount of pay, living in Yamanashi prefecture isn't that bad, the rent's cheap, and I get national insurance, you know?*  
>  
>*But I don't care about that sort of stability. Right now I'm far more concerned about the fact that the game industry, which is built from the balance between developers, publishers, and users, is beginning to fall apart at the seams. I think it's possible for me, as a developer, to have people think about this problem through the development work I do. If I stay in one spot, then I can only communicate this to a limited number of people around the company, but if I can go out and reach more people� I think there are lots of people with far greater abilities than myself out there in the world. I mean, I'm entirely focused on games and I really can't do all that much myself, but if I can get in touch with people that have other great talents, then I think that will set off a chemical reaction and in the end we'll have a chance to make new games and better things. People with these talents might be at a loss at what games to make, and perhaps I can help make up for that in exchange for lending me their talent. This may sound idealistic, but it's really what I think.""*  
>  
>*""If one game sells 40,000 copies and another one sells 20,000 copies, then one sold twice as much as another, right? But if you work for a company, this isn't reflected much in your salary. No matter if your game sells or not, you'll get money deposited in the bank every month on the month, so sometimes you see cases where developers get indifferent towards money and lose the feeling that they're really earning what they make. On the other hand, gamers take money out of their wallets and use it to buy your game. This difference is making gamers and developers drift farther and farther away from each other.*  
>  
>*I talked with different people from around the industry about this, and it always seemed like the people who understood what gamers want the most are the guys in sales or the guys working in the stores. But isn't that messed up? It's completely messed up that the people actually making the games are the farthest away from what gamers want. I want to do something about that. I'm not saying I want to change the game industry or anything huge like that, but I just want to do something.*  
>  
>*But coincidentally enough-we didn't arrange this or anything-some people in this same industry, people that are fairly well known as developers go, are leaving or moving around in their companies. Other things are going on besides \[Yoshiki\] Okamoto's new company... It may all be a coincidence, but there are lots of people who think the way things are right now is no good, and I think it's great to see these people going in a new direction and taking the rest of the industry along with them.""*  
>  
>*""I don't think I can take any large-scale work for a while, so I doubt I'll suddenly become director on some grandiose project. There is a chance I'll be involved in several titles at once, but I'll need to think over the balance involved carefully. I may be seriously involved in some, but on others I may let the director and staff at the office take care of it and stick to just giving advice.""*

So as you can see from the interview above, I don't think ""getting tired of making Kirby sequels forced by HAL/Nintendo"" is why Sakurai left. Sakurai isn't just criticizing Nintendo/HAL in this interview. He's criticizing the WHOLE video industry. He claims that the money that many game developers are making from game sales (at the time of the interview in 2003) are not enough to support themselves and even feeling they're not earning the money they deserve (As well as the fact how well a game sells doesn't make a big difference in paychecks for the game developers.). This has lead to game developers not wanting to take risks with new, innovative games and instead make games the feel strongly will sell well. Like sequels to an already successful series or remakes of previously successful games.

Sakurai also implies that he felt like the people who worked in sales or who sold the games knew more about what people want in a game more than the actual people who make the games. If game developers aren't connecting to their consumers and knowing what to make in a game, then this will lead to people not buying their games and companies making less money. This all leads to game developers who can't afford to lazily make a game and put their all into developing games, otherwise, they will have no money to live off of. And then there are people who are fighting over which console is better or be grouping people to playing only one type of console from a certain company. The whole industry needs to stick together to survive.

Sakurai wanted game developers to know what the audience wants so game developers could make newer and more creative games they want to make instead of needing to rely on what they know is good (Already successful series) or failing to meet expectations. Even though says he's not trying to change the game industry, that's what it feels like he wants to me. He couldn't just stay at HAL making the same type of game over and over again. So this is why he left HAL. To try and find a way for game developers to become more connected to video game players so the game developers wouldn't suffer.

He also talks about ""Yoshiki Okamoto"" who was one of the major designers/producers of Capcoms ""*Final Fight*"" and ""*Street Fighter II*"" as well as ""*Street Fighter III*"". Which are considered the most revolutionary fighting games even today. He left Capcom in 2003 (same year as the interview) which obviously caused a bit of commotion in the industry I bet. He went on to create a video game company called ""*Game Republic*"" in 2005 which eventually shut down in 2011 due to debt sadly. A year later, he later started making mobile games instead of console games for Mixi. Mixi developed Dragon Hunter and Monster Strike which eventually were really successful luckily. Anyway, Sakurai is saying that Okamoto and himself aren't the only ones who are trying to do different things in the game industry by leaving major game companies. Many others were trying to do different things at the time it seems.

So Sakurai states at the end of the interview that don't expect any large-scale projects from him or to expect him to direct any big games for a while. And that's what he did for the next couple years moving on as a freelance, game designer creating Sora Ltd. While not credited as a director, he was credited as a special adviser while working on the next Kirby major game: ""*Kirby & the Amazing Mirror*"" in 2004, showing he didn't just ditch the Kirby franchise to HAL without any guidance. He helped designed ""*Meteos*"" for Q Entertainment and ""*Mushiking: The King of Beetles*"" for Sega from what I believe. Those 2 games were both released in 2005. These were small games but he eventually started directing bigger games as we know.

EDIT- Also, according to ""DidYouKnowGaming"", some time after he left HAL, Sakurai continue to work on a magazine/book called ""*Think About the Video Games*"" which he talked about topics in the video game industry. I also found he's made a variety of books on video games and Smash Bros. which can be seen [here](https://www.amazon.com/Masahiro-Sakurai/e/B004LUYCPO%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share). He also went to Game Developers Conference where he talked about how games should have risks and rewards.

Later in 2005, Satoru Iwata (Late president of Nintendo and HAL) announced the next Super Smash Bros. game and convinced Sakurai to direct it the next day (To Sakurais suprise). Sakurai didn't think he would be directing another major game by this point but he couldn't refuse directing this game. Working with many Nintendo employees and Game Arts Ltd., they created ""Super Smash Bros. Brawl"". Then later, Iwata requested that Sakurai make a major, 3DS game which lead to the creation of ""*Kid Icarus: Uprising*"", reviving the ""*Kid Icarus*"" series which Sakurai had been hoping to do when he added Pit in SSBB. (This was created by a new company Sakurai made called ""Project Sora"" which was created in 2009 and ended in 2012 after making Uprising.) And as we know, he eventually made SSB4 and Ultimate with Bandai Namco.

I don't really know if Sakurai felt like he accomplished his goal of helping the video game creators connect with the buyers but I like to think he did. Nintendo started trying innovative things after 2003 like the DS, Wii, 3DS & Wii U. While they had some successes in some cases, they showed they didn't know what gamers want in other cases. I think the Switch is finally showing Nintendo is trying to understand what consumers want. (As well as allowing monetization for Youtubers who play their games instead of their own program.) If Sakurais goal was for all video game industries to stand together instead of fighting, I like to think with Super Smash Bros., he accomplished that. After he left HAL, SSB brought in Sonic from Sega, Snake, Simon & Rither from Konami, Megaman, Ryu & Ken from Capcom, Cloud from Square Enix, Pac Man from Namco and even Joker from Atlus ( from a game that wasn't even on a Nintendo console). That's not even counting all the trophies/spirits/assist trophies/bosses/etc. And after seeing the 3 major representatives of Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft stand on stage together at the Game Awards... I think we're together more than ever.

**Short Version - Sakurai felt there was a disconnect with the game developers and the consumers that bought their games and on what gamers want in video games or how good games should be made. This lead to the game industry suffering and getting desperate. He wanted to fix that disconnection by being able to work with a variety of  game developers as a freelancing game designer (Sora Ltd.) so he left HAL as staying at HAL limited who he would be able to work with at the company and he would be working with the same game designers over and over again. He did this until Iwata contacted him to help make the next Smash game (Brawl) which he was able to work with many other game companies such as Game Arts & Bandai Namco.**",EvanD0,1,19,105,2400,13715,0,0

There are two features that were promised before the Switch even launched:

1. The USB 3.0 port inside the dock would get enabled as a *USB 3.0 port*, allowing gigabit speeds with Ethernet adapters.

2. The ""light ring"" around the Home Button on the Joy-Cons would light up for incoming notifications of some kind.

Neither of these features have been enabled, even after two years. I bet a lot of you didn't even know the right Joy-Con *had* a blue LED under the Home Button.",razorbeamz,1,25,137,108,621,0,0

This information comes from two of Nintendo's financial reports.

86hzj0,Nintendo needs to stop giving early copies to Youtubers who put spoilers in thumbnails.,"Seriously, I'm so tired of this. People that do this are shameless, going as far as to put the **secret** final boss in the thumbnails and having titles like ""All Bosses + **Secret** Boss.""' There's a reason why these bosses are kept a secret; it's such a huge ""f you"" to the developers who want their fans to experience the joy of a surprise. 


I think what's even more frustrating is that every time I try to block the videos by clicking ""Not Interested,"" they continue to find ways to sneak into my recommended and once again spoil a big reveal. There's no point in complaining in the comments either, as they just ignore the people who do. I'm not sure what it's gonna take for these people to stop putting spoilers in the thumbnail, but there needs to be some type of punishment that convinces them to do so. I have noticed that a lot of these guys get their copies early, which is baffling to me, as I wouldn't think that Nintendo appreciates people spoiling such huge surprises. I think a good solution would be for Nintendo to stop giving copies early to them, which would probably get the message across to these uploaders that spoiling is a dick move. As for now, I've learned my lesson; I'm going to have to stop using Youtube around game releases and come back when I finish it, because I feel as if that's the only way to avoid this type of 
spoiler.

I've had a blast exploring Hyrule, but after completing the game I've been feeling a hunger for something more compact and focused in it's storytelling.

Back when Ocarina of Time was a resounding success a second game using a lot of the same assets came soon after that was far more experimental, Majora's Mask. It had fewer dungeons, and in terms of scale the world was more compact to account for the three day cycle. It was a risky move, but a mitigated risk as they already had the controls built ahead of time with Ocarina of Time.

I would love to see them do the same thing with Breath of the Wild's ~~predecessor~~ successor. Use the same engine and tweak the existing assets to create another *weird* but enjoyable experience.",FrighteningWorld,1,13,73,171,919,0,0

I wanna' thank /u/Nintendo_America for being more retroactively involved in the community. It's really cool seeing you guys around more often and having a very fun interaction.

EDIT: **This is not a forum to discuss modding, hacking, emulation, homebrew or anything else related.** If this is something that interests you, there are plenty of resources available elsewhere.

**EDIT 2:** u/Sandels2200 has pointed out that the Wii Shop **may still be available AFTER January 30, 2019** for redownloading purposes.

5207tt,How I know Nintendo cares about their fans,"A few months ago, my brother Matthew died suddenly due to something called SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy.)  I wrote a letter to Nintendo regarding our bond over Zelda and about how much Breath of the Wild meant to me.

http://www.zeldainformer.com/exclusives/nintendo-enabled-a-fan-to-keep-a-lost-brother-around-thanks-to-breath-of-th

Thanks to Zelda Informer, Nintendo received my letter.  They were kind enough to send me an EXTREMELY generous care package.

Thank you Nintendo and Zelda Informer for being awesome (again).  It's truly refreshing to know that even a large gaming corporation cares enough to not only respond, but send very thoughtful swag to cheer up a greaving gamer.

(Also:  we are raising money for the Epilepsy Foundation in Matt's honor via a Zelda marathon live stream, called ""Moblins For Matt.""  Come support a good cause at www.twitch.tv/moblinsformatt)

But that does explain why bandai namco has become nintendo's go to studio for development support, they basically pay them extra to do so.",TheGoldminor,1,10,58,59,404,0,0

For me...I’ve been playing a LOT of Luigi of all people. I never really played much of luigi in any of the previous games, but for some reason when I played as him this time around, it just clicked. Maybe his floaty style fits in with the heaviness of Ultimate?

Who are yall playin as so far?

I spent much of this year working to uncover an unreleased Gameboy add-on called the WorkBoy. It was a keyboard add-on being developed by Fabtek and Source in collaboration with Nintendo and appeared at CES 1992 but disappeared shortly after that. I was finally able to get my hands on a prototype and it still works! I made a documentary about my research into the project and how I obtained the prototype. It's a long, crazy story with many twists. You can see it here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZcrPM-jDqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZcrPM-jDqY)

ic363n,We NEED Nintendo in the Middle East,"Hi. This may sound weird to people not in the middle east,So I'll explain.
Video games are a huge part of the middle east, we have a LOT of gamers, but most of them play Playstation and Xbox games, I've seen a very few amount of people who actually play Nintendo games. The most succes Nintendo had in the Middle East are probably Mario Maker (1 & 2) and the newly released Animal Crossing New Horizons, but it's not the gamers' fault, there hasn't been ANY offical Nintendo office in an Arabic country, 22 COUNTRIES and over 428,000,000 PEOPLE!! Now how will that make Nintendo more successful??

1.Arabic is the 5th most spoken language in the world, so I think you now know how BIG of a language it is. So if any person who speaks arabic wouldn't buy a switch or any Nintendo game because it's a language he/she (probably) doesn't understand, but If it was in arabic it would be more appealing to him/her because it's a language they obviously understand. Why does Sony's PlayStation 4 hold 75% market share in Saudi Arabia? it's because it's in Arabic!

2.countries in the Middle East are EASILY one of the most ""video games cause violence!"" Countries out there. So if a mom saw this kid friendly console with games for all the family, it would be a no-brainer to buy! Many countries most notably Syria,Lebanon,Palastine,Iraq, and many other countries don't have any offical way to play Nintendo games besides importing.

3.bring more people into playing video games in general, just look at the wii, why did it do so well? Because it was more understandable to the general masses or in other words ""casuals""
Many people refuse to play games in the middle east because they are too complicated or too violence. Games like animal crossing and mario party for example are PERFECT for these type of people and games like Zelda and (kinda) Mario odyssey will also be perfect for the people who only play hardcore games.

Hope You Understand

Edit:Just wanted to say THANK YOU to everybody for making this thread popular, I LOVED hearing your stories and comments and I really love that I could share this problem in this subreddit, I hope that all Countries EVENTUALLY can have access to Nintendo games and Nintendo should also focus more on expanding their brand everywhere in places like India,Brazil (Read Edit 2),South Asia, etc. Not necessarily fully translate their games but at least make them more available, thank you for listening! I have a [YouTube Channel ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEEaSD3bsoRDKqCXiW3L3fQ) about Nintendo and gaming related stuff, feel free to visit if you're interested!

Edit 2: Nintendo Brazil is officially a thing now!([Source](https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1296084506613624834?s=19)) I'm very happy for you Brazilians! That means Nintendo is trying to expand to other Countries, if you live in a place where there is no offical way to buy a switch, just be patient because it may even happen this year!

du4qyo,"I'm surprised I haven't seen much talk about this, but Luigi's Mansion 3 is a new high for Charles Martinet.","Yes, his Mario and especially Luigi voice sound a lot different in this game (mostly due to age, you can't blame him.), but honestly, this features some of Martinet's most nuanced and intricate voice work to-date. (Possibly even surpassing his work on Wario World, Wario Ware Gold, Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Mario Strikers Charged, which I hold as my top 5 favorite performances from the man.)

I'm actually astounded how well this man can outdo himself and make such nuanced and emotional delivery with just funny cartoony accents with a limited vocabulary often consisting of; ""wahoo, it's a me, yippee, Mama Mia""

I'm also happy that the Mario characters have been expanding their vocabulary in this game.

Now, now, it's just surreal, this man is getting old, his voices don't quite sound the same as he used to, but he still put his heart into Luigi's Mansion 3. God bless this man.

I'm currently working on a new update to Baba Is You which'll add a level editor, an online level-sharing system and 200+ new levels, along with new music, things to look at, commentary, and so on! The current timeline is that the editor should release around December, but the timing is a bit hazy still.

You can find my homesite at [https://www.hempuli.com](https://www.hempuli.com)

9tuahf,I'm Oliver Davies. I was a game designer at Rare between 1994 and 1997. AM(A)A...,"Hello, I'm Oliver.


I became a game designer almost accidentally and was lucky enough to do so working for Rare at the peak of their powers (between 1994 and 1997). During that time I tested DKC, did conceptual design work on DKC2, was lead designer and project lead on Ken Griffey Jr's Winning Run, before working on both Project Dream (later Banjo-Kazooie) and Goldeneye 64.


After 13 years in the game industry, I moved into education and now run a Masters course in the Netherlands. In my spare time I write and have just published a [novel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JLVK441) and a [collection of short stories](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JL124W9). I've made the short stories available free to download this weekend in case anyone here fancies reading them...


It's currently 3pm where I am, and I'll be around for much of the afternoon and evening in order to answer any questions you might have on what it was like working at Rare, what I still remember of the place and the games I worked on, and (almost) anything else...


EDIT - It's 4pm and I just need to run a couple of errands. Once I'm back I'll get on with answering questions...

EDIT 2 - It's 4.30pm and I'm back. Answering some more while I drink tea...

EDIT 3 - Wow. I was expecting three questions and I have quite a few more. Need to walk my dog, but I'll be back after I'm done and answer some more questions. Currently intending to answer everything asked. Let's see if I manage! Back in a bit :)

EDIT 4 - Back. Replying to more but, the Liverpool game is on so my typing may be effected by 90 minutes of clenching...

EDIT 5 - Well, I've answered as many questions as I could manage today and enjoyed it thoroughly. And Liverpool managed to hold on for a draw. Plus I ate some nice cake. But I need to call a halt for the day. I'll try to answer some more questions tomorrow if I can find time. Thanks a lot for having me [r/nintendo](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/), it's been fun! :)

EDIT 6 - It's 11.43am and I wandered back to see if there had been a question or two more. Sweet Christmas, as Luke Cage might say, there are more than I anticipated. I've got a little bit of time spare, so I'll answer some more questions..

EDIT 7 - So, I still have lots of questions left to answer. But, I am going to do my level best to continue answering them over the course of the upcoming week. This may make this the longest/slowest AMA you've had in these parts, but I'd feel bad not getting back to people who took time out to ask me something. And, if I *never* reply to you; it's not you, it's probably me. Getting hard to keep track of what I've answered and what I haven't. But, will do my best. And thanks again for having me, was a fun experience! :)",therealoliverdavies,1,15,81,501,2745,0,0

“Hmmm…well, I have to hand it to them. This time they’ve managed to come up with a decent storyline that doesn’t involve the usual golden bananas. Only joking kids! This one’s worse than all the previous efforts put together! I know you probably aren’t expecting a best seller, but wait til’ you hear this load of rubbish…”

The pause menu/status screen:

“I knew they’d have to have something like this. The Kongs will be so weighed down with all the garbage they have to collect, I can’t see them getting past the second level. You can view all this silly nonsense and some other stuff I don’t understand by pressing START during your game.”

Multiplayer:

“It’s true, I’m afraid. They’ve gone and included one of those awful multiplayer modes that seem to be all the fashion these days. This means you and some other whippersnappers can huddle round your flickering screen and play a few games that I reckon were thrown in at the last minute and will be average at best.”

The Nintendo 64 controller:

“Arrgh! What is that thing? There are too many buttons… and this wobbly stick-thing feels like it’s broken! I can’t believe players use this silly controller contraption to play games!”

Under header “Cranky’s Tips”:

“Tough luck kid. I’ve been told to keep my mouth shut, as they want to keep all the good stuff for a money-making strategy guide. I’m sure some of it will appear on that newfangled “internet” thing as well, so I suggest you take a look-see there. You could also ask your friends, assuming of course you’ve got any. If all else fails, you’ll just have to play better.”

His role in the game (He gives you new abilities):

“Now don’t you go asking me for a potion of gameplay, as even my genius can’t rescue this game from it’s rightful destiny in the bargain bin.”

Funky Kong’s role:

“Lazy, rude and loud he may be, but Funky the monkey stocks the necessary firepower you’re gonna need to blast your way through the collection of mediocrity known as the levels.”

“Funky stocks the following shooters, all of which can hopefully be upgraded, if you can get that far into the game without falling asleep.”

Golden Bananas, the main collectable:

“If you find more than ten, I’ll be surprised.” (There’s 201 in the game.)

Animal Crates (Which allow you to play as different animals):

“I just hope they’ve included poor old Winky and Expresso this time instead of that bone-brained rhino that always seems to get in the games.” (Winky and Expresso are, in fact, not in the game while Rambi the rhino is.)

Bananaport Pads (Which teleport you around):

Let me know if you find a bananaport that can take me out of this sorry game, and I’ll be there in a flash.""

Switches:

“The best switch is the one on top of your N64…”

Tag Barrels (Which allow you to switch characters):

“Players less skilled than myself (i.e., all of you) will also be relieved to find that your energy is replenished during a visit to these barrels, too.”

However, I'd vote Star Fox 64. I feel the jump in the gameplay department was immense. I find the enemies too hard to hit in the SNES game and SF64 was always so fluid to me with its aiming, movement, acrobatics, homing shots, not to mention the graphics, higher FPS, more stuff on screen, fleshed out environments, etc.

It's not that I dislike the music by other game companies but when leaving open the menu of another game or console, the music starts to get exhausting after a while. The same goes for smaller sound effects that you'll hear a million times while playing a game.

Maybe the best way to explain it is that I'm never annoyed having their tunes stuck in my head on a loop. And I feel like that was done on purpose and that it deserves some recognition. They obviously put a lot of thought into it and it shouldn't go unnoticed.",,1,38,196,128,669,0,0

7rs640,"Four days ago I posted a meme about lurking the /r/splatoon board since I couldn't play. Thanks to one beautiful redditor, that's now changed.","Four days ago I saw something on /r/surrealmemes that I thought was perfect for the /r/splatoon board. I played a TON of Splatoon 1 on the WiiU to the point where it ranks the highest on my play log. When 2 was announced I was ECSTATIC. I follow everything about it and love the series completely. I bought the original 3 pack and the alt color Amiibo, the Callie and Marie two pack, the Jakks Pacific 2 inch figures including one of each color squid they came out with. Everything I could to support the big N helping to bring such a fresh new IP to our table. Except one thing. Splatoon 2. 

Going back a little, the year of 2014 was rough for me emotionally. My parents had moved in with my grandmother due to her having dementia and not being able to be by herself. Later that year, my dad is diagnosed with cancer. My mom is unable to work due to severe back injuries she got on the job when I was younger that were made worse by malpractice. And on top of that, I had a younger brother in middle school at the time. So I drop everything of my life a state over. I left a good job and a long time girlfriend (7 years, we split as friends since she didn't want to live in my home state and I couldn't blame her). I grabbed my kitties (like HELL I'm losing my cats) and booked it back home. Home being the boonies of South Carolina living in the middle of farmland.

I was lucky to grab a job as they are incredibly hard to get in this area and it was great until 2016. Fast forward to March 2016, my company gets bought out. We are forced to train our replacements then when that was done, the people that trained would mysteriously commit some act that would land them fired shortly after. In November of that year it happens to me. Though I never got finished training my replacement as my coworker and I were fired for store being robbed. Since then I've had a few small jobs here and there. Helping out doing IT stuff for the older crowd and helping out on some local farms when they need it; that sort of thing. But games are where I bury my thoughts. It's not healthy, but I'm working on it.

During that time the Switch is announced and I'm ECSTATIC. I've always been a Nintenhoe since I was a kid and I couldn't see anything wrong with the new system outside of it being a little weak. Time goes on and eventually Spla2n is released to much hype and all my old friends move to that. But since money was and is super tight I wasn't able to ever grab either of those things to join in. 

Back to the present, I make [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/7qtne0/lurking_the_subreddit_even_though_you_cant_afford/). I thought it was pretty funny seeing as how all I can really do on the Splatoon boards is lurk anyway. I don't think anything else of it except that a few other lurkers in the same spot as me might find it funny, and others due to how absurd the meme is. But then, I get a message from someone with this:  

Hi!

> I saw your meme in the Splatoon subreddit and wanted to see if I can help. Do you currently have a Switch? Or are you short the funds for the game? Either way, I’d like to chip in somehow.
> 
> I’m not looking for anything in return, I’m just hoping I can somehow share this game with another person. That’s how much I enjoy this game.
> 
> Please don’t hesitate to let me know what your situation is (if you’re willing), and we’ll find a solution.
> 
> 🙂  

We talk and exchange some stories and while I was raised to believe that you should help others but not accept help since it would make you a burden, I eventually actually accepted.

So yesterday I get a call from my neighbor that the mailman left a package for me at her house by mistake (same side road, but she's -A and I'm -D, so it's common) and I should come pick it up. Needless to say I was kinda surprised by how big the box was, but Amazon doesn't always pack the best as is, so I really didn't think much till I lifted off of her porch. It was heavy. The most I expected was maybe an amiibo to get my spirits up or something cute like that, so that was surprising. Neighbor wasn't home so I opened it on her porch to peek inside. 

[It blew my f'ing mind.](https://imgur.com/a/K3a0N)

This person, this incredible person that I connected with over a few posts, sent me not only a copy of Splatoon 2, but a dang SWITCH as well. 

My adrenaline kicked in instantly and I started trembling and welling up. This pass Christmas and my Birthday(two days after) I didn't celebrate presents wise since my family even afford gifts for each other, much less anything large like this. So I was hit rather hard. I stayed on that porch for almost twenty minutes trying to calm down. 

Thank you /u/Gergich_was_here. You are truly a saint. I can't wait to be your squadmate for years to come.

TL;DR   

I posted a [meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/7qtne0/lurking_the_subreddit_even_though_you_cant_afford/) and /u/Gergich_was_here gave me a [heart attack](https://imgur.com/a/K3a0N).

This hasn't been a great year. In fact, over the last couple of months, situations snowballed into a huge, really hard to deal with mess. Today it's my birhtday, and I expected to spend it alone. But, as I get home, I turn on my old Nintendo 2DS and fire up my not so old Pokémon Ultra Sun. As soon as I enter a PokéCenter, the lights dimmed, fireworks were fired and Nurse Joy wished me a Happy birthday. They got a grown man, who hasn't cried a tear in a few years, to his knees bawling.

So, as long as this reaches the company, thank you guys so much for keeping me company for amost 15 years! Here's to, at the very least, 15 more!

I hope this is the best place to post this - I'm not really sure how to go about writing this, so I'm just going to dive right in. My younger brother Gabe (he's three years younger than me, currently 26) was born with a congenital heart defect (CHD). His heart has a single ventricle, so there’s no wall between the two chambers resulting in half a heart. He also has a total AV canal defect, which means the middle of his heart is missing as well. At one point, doctors put a tunnel inside his heart which is now leaking badly. He is not eligible for a heart transplant, due to surgeries which have produced too many antibodies which would kill the organ. There is no solution to his condition. Due to the stress of a heart that has to work twice as hard to keep his body running, he’s had a multitude of other physical issues as well, including unstoppable weight gain. His entire life has been spent in and out of hospitals, with doctors first saying he likely wouldn’t live until 15, then 20, then 25. Yet, here he is at 26, but things have not been looking very good this year. He’s currently at home, in Woodinville, WA, and he spends most nights on oxygen, worrying that he will not wake up the next day once he falls asleep.

Since his heart could not support much physical activity, we spent our childhood together mostly playing with action figures and video games. I have many fond memories of passing over the controller between Mario levels, sitting in pajamas and battling Pokemon with an old link cable, and figuring out puzzles together in Ocarina of Time. Video games have allowed him to experience things he never would have been able to otherwise due to his special needs, and they have been an incredibly positive force in his life. A life that otherwise would have been so much more bleak, has been filled with creativity, joy, and fun, thanks to video games. They have sparked inspiration as he explored creative outlets through art, clay, and LEGOs. Regardless of the absolute garbage he’s had to deal with due to the heart he was given, he is one of the most upbeat, loving, strong-willed, and funny people on the planet. 

Of course, being that he is my brother I am in immense denial that his time here might be coming to an end, but the reality of the situation is that his heart can not handle the load of his body any more. While he plays pretty much every video that comes out for every system, above all he is a Nintendo fan, first and foremost. His room is filled with memorabilia, and Pokemon and Zelda are pretty much his favorite things in the universe. He has been eagerly anticipating Zelda: Breath of the Wild, however the chances of him living to see its release are not great. My mother has tried contacting Nintendo twice to see if there’s any way he could visit and play a build of the game (he has done game testing before and does not mind an incomplete experience, and they live in Woodinville which is next door to Redmond, Nintendo’s headquarters) but she has received no response. 

With the clock ticking, I turn to Reddit to see if anyone can help. I have no idea if it’s possible for him to play Breath of the Wild, but at this point any kind of response or experience from Nintendo would bring so much joy to my brother. Thank you to anyone who has read this, and much love and appreciation for any assistance. If there’s any additional information I should include I will update this post accordingly, or if I should post this anywhere else I will do so.

Edit: Thanks so much for the responses and suggestions! I'm out right now but when I get home I'll put together a change.org petition and Facebook post, and I'll share the links here when they're ready.

Edit 2: Well, this post has barely been up for a few hours and I have already been contacted by Nintendo's social media team regarding getting Gabe to Nintendo to play the new Zelda. I am absolutely floored. We just had lunch and I told him about this post and read him many of your responses and he broke down into tears out of joy and appreciation for everyone's kind words. I will keep updating this post regarding Gabe's visit with Nintendo, as things are figured out. Here's a photo of us at lunch, my brother in his glorious Pikmin shirt: http://imgur.com/4XFBlzD

Edit 3: Wow. Just, wow. I never would have imagined this post would receive 2500+ upvotes and such an incredible response. And reddit gold! Never got that before, certainly a fun little bonus. Thank you all so much, my family has read every comment and the kind words mean the world to us. Gabe and I watched the Switch reveal trailer this morning and were freaking out. I have received confirmation that today I will be speaking to someone at Nintendo to make things happen. None of this would have been possible without all of you, I thank you all so much. For those interested, I will keep posting updates as things happen, not sure when he'll get to visit but any pictures I am able to post I will share with everyone. <3<3<3

Edit 4: The wheels are in motion, I spoke to some incredibly kind people at Nintendo, and since I am returning back to New York today (where I live, I was visiting for the week) I gave them my mom's contact info to make things happen. I'm not sure what kind of timeline we're looking at, but once I have pictures and more information to share I'll post them either here or in a new post. Thanks again to everyone.

The last time we were able to play it was with the back-compatible Nintendo Wii model, a console discontinued in 2011, using the 2002 or 2003 disc. I personally find it a great game, it's one of my favourites 3d Mario games. I hope that Nintendo re-releases (or remasters) it on Switch.

d94782,"Mario Kart Tour is everything I want in a MK game, presented in the exact wrong way","Mario Kart Tour just launched, and being the die-hard Mario Kart fan that I am, I downloaded it to see what it's like. My first impression was that it was just another gacha game - play races to earn coins and rubies, use those to unlock new characters and parts, and play until you lose interest. But it doesn't take much time at all before you are hit with a slew of content that was honestly a bit unexpected for me.

There is no denying that being a mobile game was apparently not an issue. Mario Kart Tour still has the guts of a standard Mario Kart game, and with features that fans have been asking for for a while now. The whole game is basically weekly sets of challenge packs, akin to Mario Kart Wii's online mode. Characters each have their own special moves similar to Mario Kart Double Dash. Karts and characters level up and become more useful, which is something I personally never asked for, but I love the addition of.

But then of course there is the bad. While this game has substance, it lacks presentation. Firstly the controls are terrible. Auto-accelerate is always on and the game makes you choose between drifting and steering. If you like regular steering, you cant drift at all. If you want to drift around corners, you arent allowed to steer normally, even just to slightly realign your kart with the track. There are no basic Grand Prix or a VS mode, your only way of playing courses is through the Tours, which all reset after two weeks. And then lies my biggest fear. A few months ago, Pokemon Rumble Rush launched with similar mechanics, only after the two weeks, all of your progress was locked and you had to start from scratch with a new set of challenges. If that ends up being the case here too, I will swiftly uninstall this game and never think about it again.

If some of these ideas could just make their way over to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, or even Mario Kart 9 at this point, I would be beyond satisfied. But where is stands now, Mario Kart Tour doesnt look like its going to be able to keep a steady audience

EDIT:

I would like to just make one side note about the pricing for this game. The game does not feel tedious to a point where you will ever feel you have to pay for microtransactions. The only negative cost is the Gold Pass, which unlocks 200cc mode and various kart options. At $4.99/month, the Gold Pass is three times more expensive than the Switch's entire online service. Even their monthly (and most expensive) price point is $3.99 a month. A really don't know what Nintendo was thinking when they approved this.

EDIT 2:

As several people have pointed out, and I have now learned - you can turn and steer at the same time. However, this requires using tilt controls in order to steer and swiping the screen to drift. This may work for you, for me and many others it does not. Tilt controls are imprecise and nowhere near what I would call ideal. Needing to rely on two separate forms of input for proper steering is just bad game design, especially when neither of which provide haptic feedback.

EDIT 3:

Just some final notes on the game. I have been playing it on and off for most of the day and its pretty alright. Certain courses feel awful just due to turning, which you are never going to adapt to. Its not a matter of getting use to controls, its a matter of the steering mechanics just being bad. For the courses that actually work well, the game is fun to play. But remember - Tours reset every two weeks. You can not just go on whenever and play any course you want, which sucks. I hope Nintendo realizes these flaws soon and fixes the game. As I stated above, all the elements of a great Mario Kart game are already here.",Yerm_Terragon,1,17,83,685,3693,0,0

https://preview.redd.it/3suwr2v04la21.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a1c9961fff4122579b018b4bceafc60b4eac4c87

Hey everyone,

I'm not the type of snowflake who takes every tiny issue to social media in a hope to soothe the pain and shower myself in the comments like ""yeah bro I feel you!!!""

Never done this before.

But I genuinely feel like when one experiences a so-called customer service that is beyond ridiculous, it deserves the right to be published. So here it goes:  My little one wanted a Nintendo Switch for quite a while, so this Christmas I took a deep breath and splashed £350 on a Switch with some games, Mario Kart and Odyssey ? (I'm far from gaming, so pardon my ignorance) She was over the moon. She has never had a console before and is not a gaming type of person, but I guess every kid gets excited when they see Mario. Oh yeah, and as a good parent I only allowed 2 hours of play a day ;)

Three days later she asked me to take a look if everything was functioning as it supposed to, she seemed quite concerned. I did give Mario Odysseey a go and realised the Blue Joy con was initiating unnecessary moves on its own. The joystick kept  constantly moving left  for no apparent reason. At that time she had only played her new Nintendo for not more than a couple of times.

It became evident that the Blue Joy con was malfunctioning. Naturally, I went onto [https://www.nintendoservicecentre.co.uk/](https://www.nintendoservicecentre.co.uk/) and booked a repair. I followed the instructions and included a proof of purchase - a printed email from Official Nintendo e-Shop I bought the console from. It was a Christmas period so I decided to include a little Merry Christmas note, knowing that it might brighten the day of whoever is going to open that parcel.   A week late I received an email from Nintendo Repairs stating the following:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i34kfcp43la21.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1184d8e96280770fc1ea96a1a7380da2eb311833

Basically, the repair team decided that I have to pay £29 to have the Joy-con repaired even though it was faulty ever since we've got the console. I did not quite understand the reason of damage (No / bad function Circle Pad, anyone?) but from what I understand they're implying that someone must have caused damage to the Joy Con and it's now beyond the warranty. I would like to stress out once again that my little one is in Year 2 and she's not some heavy gamer teenager that bashes joysticks against the wall when they're asked to have lunch mid-game.

&#x200B;

Following this email, I have contacted [https://www.nintendoservicecentre.co.uk/](https://www.nintendoservicecentre.co.uk/) and tried to solve this issue over the phone. A guy named Julian asked whether I have included the proof of purchase in the parcel when I sent out the Joy Con for repair. I confirmed I did. He then went:

""Ok sir this is very strange as it is obviously a factory fault considering the fact you've only just recently got your Nintendo Switch""

""Please reply to my email with a screenshot of proof of purchase and I will make sure it gets repaired and sent out to you within the the next couple of days"" he continued.

&#x200B;

Below is Julian's reply:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/seeo60ib3la21.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=65c4c15007d3982eeb9746eb46bbba9e5113b93f

I immediately responded with a screenshot of a receipt from the Official Nintendo Online Store. With my  name, my order number and the date. Having a very strange feeling that this is going nowhere I asked Julian to confirm the receipt of my email with the screenshot.

""Yes, sir I have it here on my side. Worry not, I am going to have this repaired and sent out asap""

It was Friday 11 Jan.

Yesterday (Monday 14 Jan)  I decided to check the status of my repair on [https://www.nintendoservicecentre.co.uk/](https://www.nintendoservicecentre.co.uk/) Not much to my surprise it said (and still is saying at the time of writing)

&#x200B;

AWAITING PAYMENT

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/93mkxy9g3la21.png?width=461&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=843ce9a8d1eef3642c51c60fa555cb97f62d636f

&#x200B;

Probably Julian had a blasting weekend after our conversation and realised he is not in the mood to chase this up with the repair team.   I phoned them up again, this time I've spoken to Raphael, chewing  the same story all over again. Guess what Raphael said?

You will never guess.

""Sir, I have just looked through your case and wanted to let you know that the receipt you've emailed us is not a valid proof of purchase""

&#x200B;

One more time:  THE RECEIPT YOU'VE EMAILED US IS NOT A VALID PROOF OF PURCHASE

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r1jvyvxj3la21.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c0e883ec86ccbe0c429969b60cf1e0e2c7a44f80

Knowing for sure that I am going to explode, I tried as hard as I could to contain my anger, frustration, disappointment, surprise and shock, I kindly noted to Raphael that I have purchased my Nintendo Switch from the Official Nintendo UK Store and that my proof of purchase that I've emailed them includes an order number which can be easily validated and confirmed within their Sales department.

Raphael wasn't convinced, he continued:  ""Yes I understand, let me see what I can do for you, I will email you asap""

&#x200B;

He did not email me at all.

&#x200B;

Realising that [https://www.nintendoservicecentre.co.uk/](https://www.nintendoservicecentre.co.uk/) is just a bunch of funny people that have absolutely no interest in you, your Nintendo-related issues and subsequently Nintendo brand image I decided to call their Sales team, in a hope to stumble upon someone in sound mind.

I did. It was Daniel.

Very kind, very polite, genuinely showed a lot of interest in my issue, acknowledging the fact that is beyond ridiculous, after I filled him in and put an emphasis on ""Your receipt is not a valid proof of purchase"" Daniel promised he is going to escalate this to his management and get back to me in a couple of hours with the result.

He did not.

As of today, I still haven't heard from Nintendo. Nobody phoned me. Nobody emailed me with any updates.  My little one keeps asking when her blue joy-con is coming back and I honestly have no clue.  In the past, I have experienced a tremendously horrible service before, but quite frankly the service almost always matched the company's status and image it was provided by.

Never expected this from Nintendo. I always thought of them as a family-children-oriented company that puts their customer first. As I mentioned earlier I am not a gamer myself, but I did have a Nintendo back in 80, guess their customer service used to be way much better back then.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

Massive thanks to everyone who upvoted this. I really appreciate everyone's involvement and support. It is really great to know that there are people willing to help.

&#x200B;

For those wondering If I have sent them a wrong receipt, below is exactly what I have emailed them. My order number is there too. When I said I paid £350 it was including the Mario Kart game that I have purchased separately a few hours later.

I thought someone here might want them. My hope is that it’d go to someone who will hang them up rather than sell them, as I could do that and could use the money. 

The posters are still in very good condition. 

I’m willing to ship anywhere in the 48 contiguous US! 

The winner will be chosen randomly from the comment section. In the comments, I’d love it if you commented your favorite soundtrack from a Nintendo videogame. I’m learning Piano and I’m on the hunt for great music to learn (: 

I’ll announce the winner on July 15th at 12PM MST

I am the author of Supper Mario Broth, a blog dedicated to showcasing the most unexplored, most unknown, and most obscure depths of the Mario franchise. Since 2012, I have published over 8,000 findings covering every facet of the world of Super Mario: unused assets, undocumented glitches, scans of rare print material, photos of obscure unlicensed merchandise, and thousands of facts you never knew. The content is split between featuring the discoveries of others, sourced and attributed to the best of my ability in accordance to my extremely strict veracity policy; and my own discoveries. If you like looking at Mario pictures on the Internet, chances are, you have seen many that originate on Supper Mario Broth - like [Big Yoshi](https://www.patreon.com/posts/search-for-big-21801616) and the Mario/Peach and Luigi/Daisy [mustache/eyelash design parallel](http://www.suppermariobroth.com/post/161978403880). I dedicate my time every day to finding more obscure Mario content, and I am looking forward to any questions you have about the blog!

For reference, the Supper Mario Broth body of content consists of the following:

[The main site](http://suppermariobroth.com/), featuring posts with high-resolution or animated images, as well as those requiring extended commentary;

[The MarioBrothBlog Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MarioBrothBlog), for discoveries that are able to fit into one image with a short description;

[The Supper Mario Broth Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/suppermariobroth), where I provide my subscribers weekly long-form articles (5,000-10,000 words) going in maximum depth on select Mario topics;

and the [Small Mario Findings side blog](https://smallmariofindings.tumblr.com/), for content that is likely to only be of interest to the most avid Mario enthusiasts.

Note that there is zero overlap in content between any of these accounts, so there is no risk of seeing duplicate posts if you read all of them. Thank you very much for reading!",MarioBrothBlog,1,19,106,283,1994,0,0

fij3kl,PSA: Don't buy even a single game from G2A. I leaned the hard way.,"My account has been suspended for buying a game from there without thinking. All of my digital games are gone. All of my uploaded saves are gone. Everything is gone. I own(ed) well over a thousand dollars in games purchased directly through the eShop. 

UPDATE: The G2A code I purchased was definitely bought with a stolen credit card, which was charged back. Nintendo support told me to provide proof that I have received a refund and they will unban my account. Fortunately, I purchased the key though PayPal, so that should not be an issue. The Nintendo support supervisor told me that I probably shouldn't waste my time trying to get a refund from G2A and that PayPal is my best option.

UPDATE 2: I sent Nintendo, as they requested, screenshot proof of my initial G2A purchase with the code itself in the picture, a screenshot of my PayPal transaction, and a screenshot of the disputes I filed. I'm waiting to see if I can be refunded by G2A or PayPal. Hopefully even if they don't refund me, Nintendo will give me the account back. I have sent them tons of concrete proof that I purchased the code through G2A. I sent these things yesterday and I'm awaiting them to contact me. 

UPDATE 3: PayPal has denied me a refund. I am still awaiting Nintendo's response.

UPDATE 4: It's been five days and I'm still awaiting Nintendo's response 🙁

UPDATE 5: It's been seven days. Nothing. I've called with my reference number and the superviser told me everything looks good, but they're waiting for their ""back office"" to process it. I'm assuming the state of things in the world has something to do with the delay.

Update 6: My ban has been lifted along along with a “Don’t ever do that again” warning. Looks like all-in-all, it ended up taking about ten days. 

Update 7: I have been refunded directly from G2A after the original seller shut down the refund process twice. 

Thanks for the silver despite my misspelling of the word ""learned."" Thank you for the gold. Hopefully you can learn from my stupidity.",ck02623,1,14,66,355,2010,0,0

This could not be further from the case.

All these articles are saying is that Microsoft is giving developers access to the Xbox Live XDK to be able to add Xbox Live to their mobile and Switch games as they choose.

You know how with Minecraft on mobile and on Switch lets you sign into Xbox Live for crossplay with Xbox One and Windows 10? This is that.

Microsoft is just offering game developers a simple crossplay solution. There isn't even involvement from Nintendo here.

Not sure if this has been discussed on here or not but I've been working on a series going over Mario Lore for a few months now and after completing the yoshi's island saga again, I noticed something interesting that may help explain why Mario doesn't have a belly button in Odyssey.

It's nothing major, but in the beginning of Yoshi's New Island, we actually see that babies are delivered to their parents by storks from Stork cloud island, which seemingly means that the babies wouldn't be in utero. The reason this is important is because without being in the womb, they would have no need for an umbilical cord and therefore, wouldn't have a belly button!

I know it's not the most groundbreaking thing, but it's nice to know that Nintendo took enough care to ensure that Mario Lore has carried over from the Yoshi's Island games!  

Edit: Wow didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did, but if you want to learn more about my research into mario lore, [Here's the series I'm currently working on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHO3grz9cjY&list=PLcrnA6KhFeCNMd95n4sLVrSTujBgScT-l)",24kevin,1,11,61,183,1112,0,0

Ever since I was a young teen I looked forward to Nintendo’s E3 events. They had their ups and downs, but it’s been a consistent thing to look forward to
and chat about with friends and my brothers.

With COVID it’s obviously safety first. If Nintendo can’t put a digital event together because of social distancing, then they can’t.

I’m still bummed about it.

As you all must have heard by now, our beloved mascot was let go yesterday. After 35 exciting years of serving us valiantly, it was time to move on from Mario.

We'd like to thank Mario for his various contributions to gaming and to our company. Here at Nintendo, we'll never forget the great times and positive vibes he brought along with him. Mario was a great mascot, and we'll miss him dearly. We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.

But sometimes, change is a positive thing! Here at Nintendo, we love listening to fan feedback, and we've heard you loud and clear. It's time for a new mascot, designed and decided by our community.

Yes, it's true. We're giving the opportunity to our amazing fans here on the Official Nintendo reddit to design or nominate the successor to Mario. A way to ""hire this lad"", if you will.

Post all your concept art for the new mascot design in this megathread, or post nominees for who you think is most deserving of the title. Nintendo executives will be looking at every comment to try and narrow down the perfect design for our new mascot, and vetting every nominee diligently & personally.

No NSFW content and nothing with too intense of a backstory, otherwise Miyamoto will get sad.

Good luck everyone. We look forward to seeing all your wonderful new mascot concepts.

Most of the demands for streaming apps seem to be targeted at Nintendo, but they're not the ones holding them back. It's the developers of the apps. The fact that Hulu is on Switch confirms this.

dvpeqg,"Playing Ring Fit...holy crap, how is this not going to be one of the best sellers this gen once word of mouth gets around?","The tracking is almost flawless, and the game itself is masterfully designed. I though Wii Fit was brilliant, but let's face it a lot of the games were janky, with iffy motion detection. The only mini game I've played so far that feels a little off is the robot one (where they are on a production line and you're swinging around that dual bladed, foldable lightsaber thing. 

The only fault I can find with it is the loading time. A game like this should boot almost instantaneously so you can fire it up for a quick work out then get on with your day. Also switching player accounts should also be faster, if you've got someone else waiting to go after you. There should be a quick swap with no more than 2 or 3 button presses.
 
Otherwise...BRILLIANT.

I’m not really even into the whole fitness scene I just appreciate a good piece of software / hardware design.


EDIT: Just to expand on why it's so clever, there are two aspects to it: 

1) Remember with Wii Fit, the Balance board was not connected to you, so the game had to do a lot of guessing. Upper body workouts in particular had to use the pressure and pivoting detected at your feet to try to figure out roughly what was going on up above, so it would often be janky / desynced, and / or easy to trick if you were taking short cuts. With Ring Fit, because the Joycon is strapped to your leg it's infinitely more accurate. It also works in conjunction with the second Joycon, so if you are trying to cheat by not bending properly and just lowering your arms, it can detect its position relative to your legs, and your legs relative to the ground using gyros and triangulation. Lastly, another scenario where you would get lots of desyncing in Wii Fit was due to only having one Wii Remote. This also meant a lot of cheating / getting lazy and desyncing was possible, because it didn't know what was going on in your other hand. The solution? Make it so both your hands are holding the same object (the Ring) - that way the software doesn't need to know what your left hand is doing, cause it's going to be working in perfect unison with your right hand...because as I said it's holding the SAME object. GENIUS. And this same object provides physical resistance. Once the elegance of this design hit me I was in awe - while other companies would have used expensive cameras, more sensors, bleeding edge tech to solve this problem, Nintendo instead uses a freaking plastic ring. HA! 

At first I thought the ring design was arbitrary - it could have been any exercise object and it would have worked. But upon closer examination it's a carefully considered, highly intentional design.

2) Going with an RPG format, which is great for exercise as you see those experience points building up, and a sense of progression as you go through the story. I think they should provide more adventures over time as DLC to keep people engaged. Mini games alone may not keep people coming back over the long haul, but a new adventure every few months would really help with longevity.",PablosScripts,1,24,122,551,3033,0,0

hlyrgs,Regarding sexual assault allegations in the Super Smash Bros. community and our past AMA with ZeRo,"# Dear r/Nintendo Community,

Over the past few weeks many victims have come forward to reveal instances of sexual abuse, with many prominent figures in the Super Smash Bros. community being the perpetrators. A few of these situations involves ZeRo, who has admitted to abusing two underage fans by engaging in inappropriate conversations that involved requesting photos and directing at least one of the victims to perform sexual acts. One of his victims provided their account in a **[tweet](https://twitter.com/katietwtlonger/status/1278970922435776517?s=20)** recently.

In light of this situation, **we are removing our past AMA with ZeRo from the subreddit.** r/Nintendo is not a place to glorify the accomplishments of people who engage in this behavior.

The r/Nintendo moderator team and our many wonderful members stand in solidarity with all of the victims who are bravely coming forward to hold their abusers accountable. As a Nintendo community, it we must provide a space for people to feel safe, and to tell their stories of abuse. It is also our responsibility to make clear that **any individual who engages in any act of harm or abuse has no place on r/Nintendo.**

For those who have courageously told their story: thank you for sharing these deeply painful events, and for giving voice to others who may not have yet told their own story. Anyone has been a victim of abuse as a result of interacting with any member of the wider Nintendo community is welcome here, and we will do everything we can to ensure your voice is heard.",IwataFan,1,16,98,253,1548,0,0

lwvo2b,[OPINION] Nintendo should create a game where Wario and Waluigi are the main characters,"Yes, i know that is never gonna happen since Nintendo tends to give Waluigi the least attention possible(they dosen't even bother adding him into any WarioWare or Wario Land), but i think it's a big missed opportunity not doing that.

 First, Wario and Waluigi are the perfect duo and they have so much potential for a video game. The fact that they are some kind of stupid bad guys really make laugh and i really want to see that in a video game. Also, i think that's very sad that Waluigi as never appeared in any Wario game since they are best friends. They could be in a game like Mario and Luigi but instead of being heros, they act kind of like some bad guys and i think it's going really funny. Their main goal could be getting the most money possible(like in Wario Land).

Lastly, Waluigi is one of the most loved characters in the Mario community, espacially with the smash meme who gave him more popularity. It's been a while that fans want Nintendo to give more love to Waluigi. I bet if Nintendo realeased a game where Waluigi has a bigger role than being a playable character in spinoffs is going to create memes, which can make the game sold more.

Long story short I figured out how to redownload them (old ps3 died), and when I couldn’t get them to work (or even show up on the Home Screen), I realized it was because I needed to download the demos as well for some of the content to be accessible. It turns out that what I did download were just the ‘demo unlocking’ portion. So basically the free demos are the full game just not unlocked.

11c88ry,"When I was younger, I was on PlayStation Home and did something worthy of a scolding.","When I was younger I was on PlayStation Home and made a decision that I know was terrible in hindsight. 

PlayStation Home was certainly something. A social hub with a variety of games to play. My favorite was called - if I remember correctly - Salt 2. It was a racing game with speeders, and for some reason the first iteration of the game was a mech-style shooter. There were also crappy dance parties, cringy flirting, have house/apartment, and probably a lot of unsavory stuff (like A/S/L crap). This kind of game was in at the time. Like a less cartoony version of Free Realms. For anybody who is unfamiliar, these games were about creating an online persona through an avatar pre-2010. 

One of the things people liked to do was share accounts...

You'd meet someone, talk about games, and somebody says, ""Hey, how about we trade passwords and download each other's games?"" Or they come right out of the gate, and the typical strategy when this happened was stall. Scammers get frustrated, people just looking to score don't try too hard. This happened to me and I stupidly said yes. 

Fortunately for me nothing happened. The account info they gave was legit and I was able to download the first Infamous (loved that game). 

Looking back, I cannot believe I was so stupid. I got lucky.

I am still too trusting, something my girlfriend likes to point out. There was this one time I was helping out a homeless man. I didn't have any cash with me, so I let him GET IN MY CAR AND WE DROVE TO THE BANK. I was an actual adult at the time, I have no excuse. But I don't give out my passwords.

Hi, All

I have just had my PS5 delivered today but as soon as I got it booted up I realised I had a huge problem. My PSN account is over 10 years old, linked to an old email account and I don't know the password anymore :(

So as anyone would I went to the website to see what troubleshooting options there were that might help me. There weren't any. I tried every single old password I could remember and used their online assistant (completely useless btw) and tweeted the askplaystation twitter and tried to unlock this ancient gmail account which has probably been deleted or something and still got absolutely nowhere. You might be thinking; ""Wouldn't you just make a new account?"" and yes I would but I have over 100 PS4 games in my library for this account, some of which I haven't even played yet.A few years ago I threw out my PS4, see my last PlayStation post for context, and I thought I would be done with them for good but the exclusives on PS5 really sucked me in this year.

But none of that is even the worst part, I was getting desperate and impatient at having a fancy bit of tech sitting there that I can't play a single game on apart from Astro playground. I tried to get one of those Twitter ""Account recovery"" accounts to do some magic and find a way into this account to reset it. And then I got scammed. I feel too much shame to say how much money I sent them. It was enough to seem reasonable but not too much to throw up the redflags straight away.

I'm an idiot, how could I be so gullible? I don't know and trust me I'm not gonna fall for that one again.

Now can anyone give me any advice on how to get this account back or at the very least some communication with playstation?",JC241102,0,8,42,345,1796,0,0

11c8kji,PlayStation 6 and my personal feeling.,"Hello everyone. I've been doing a good amount of research on recent technology that was released and or mentioned in late 2022 to early 2023. From what I've seen so far I would like to make a guess here and say that I think that it's possible that the PlayStation 6 might use all Intel parts inside.

One of the reasons I say this is because Intel's recent attempt to try their hand at the discrete GPU market. Seems like even low power versions of their ARC architecture are seen in the foreseeable future as well. Because of this, I personally feel that Intel will try to undercut AMD and make Sony an offer they can't refuse because Intel themselves are technically the underdog in the GPU segment.

I can see them using a newer 14th gen i7/i9 laptop low power CPU and a custom ARC GPU based on their ""Druid"" architecture. In this case it would be a combination of the two to make a hybrid or in this case SoC (System on a Chip). 

It's about gaining market share and what better way to do that then making custom SoCs for the best console brand in the world. Plus, Intel's color scheme does fit the PlayStation like a glove.",BeyondEllisBeck,0,6,38,211,1128,0,0

11bu827,Day 1 PlayStation 5 WiFi issue,"Hello everyone, I have one of the PlayStation 5s from release day. I don't know if that matters but I had an issue with one of my video games. For some reason it God of War Ragnarok didn't upload version 2 of it's update and skipped to Version 3(Maybe I didn't play it for a while) and that Version 2 update was giving me an error message and downloads and I couldn't get rid of it. So I decided to fully reset the PS5

Now that I've reset it, the WI-FI has not been working correctly since. I even reset it again and that didn't fix it. Everytime I turn on the PS5 I have to go into settings to connect the WiFi, I just toggle it on and off and then it will connect but even then, I'm trying to use the Funimation app and it doesn't work. The PlayStation doesn't add some photo's of titles. I've never had an issue with my WiFi until I reset it and no I can't use an Ethernet cable, even if I could. I would still want the problem resolved. I literally have a PC on the other wall of my room connected to WiFi and I have no issues.

However, what concerns me is the fact that once it starts, it doesn't really end until I turn the game off completely. It is audible even in the console's home screen (very faint buzzing).

1. Should I buy the digital version or the disc version? (I’m probably going to wait a few weeks)
2. Should I get one in person or order online.. I’ve heard that some of them got recalled, so I want to make sure I’m making the right call.

11bcqbx,Steelseries Arctis Nova 7P is the best mid-range PS5 Headset!!,"I just got a PS5 and I've been using the Pulse headset for about 2 weeks now. I'm amazed with the quality you get for just $99. I love the pulse headset but after 2 to 3 hour gaming sessions, my ears begin to hurt. So I did my research to find a good alternative and I heard a lot of good things about the arctis nova 7p. I bought one yesterday and man was I blown away with the audio quality and comfort! It doesn't have the tight clamping force that the pulse 3d had on my head. It's worth the extra $60. I was supposed to get the 7P plus but I found more pros with the Nova 7P. The 38-hr battery life and bluetooth connectivity is amazing and works very seamlessly. I recommend anyone who's looking for a decent headset to get the Steelseries Arctis Nova 7P, you won't regret it! 

*I still give a slight edge to the Pulse on audio quality as to me it sounds a bit better, it sounds more whole and intact, oh and the bass is better. But talking about comfort (which to me matters more), it's night and day with the arctis.

the router is less than a foot away from the console so signal strength is not a problem.

But over the past couple days, my triggers started to feel really strange whenever I would press them down. I figured the issue was the springs. So being really careful with my R2, I sprayed just a tiny bit of WD-40. I didn't need to take the controller apart, just a small amount fixed the issue, and it was great! However, the same thing started to happen to my L2, I did the same thing, and after a few minutes of playing, my L2 just stopped responding completely. Before anyone asks, yes I pressed the reset button on the back of the controller, and it still wasn't responding. So, I wanted to ask before I attempt to open up my controller, what should I look out for after opening it? Does anybody know what could potentially be the problem? I really don't want to spend the money to fix it if I can do it myself and I don't wanna buy a new one if I don't have to. Thanks for any assistance, and feel free to think I'm an idiot.

I had no issue with the ps5 after that until yesterday when I decided to play mw2 split screen online again…. It turned off in the middle of the match. So this is definitely because of cod. Anyone know what’s going on? I ain’t playing split screen anymore that’s for sure lol

the cooler spins very hard and sometimes the message appears

is there any relationship???

because I think the air from the psu is not being dissipated well while it is standing

however lying down the hot air from the psu seems to be dissipated in the best way as there is nothing blocking the flow

11ao0dk,Controller battery dies overnight/after turning off console,"It might've been asked a million times, but out of all articles/reddit posts, I couldn't seem to find an answer that actually helps me solve the problem. So I have a PS5 and 2 controllers (official ones). When I bought my PS5, I got an Qware charging station as a freebie. So I plugged in, all was fun and games. 

After a while, I started noticing that one controller in the docking station wasn't charging when the console was on. No biggie, cause I got two and it eventually charged. A few weeks later, I started noticing that my other controller also wasn't charging anymore when in the dock. Okay, got rid of the dock, and went for good ol' cabled charging. Didn't change. My controllers do charge when plugged in, but they empty out quite fast after turning off the console. So when I play for a couple of hours, controller is fully charged, turn it off, but when I get back to playing a few hours later, it's almost dead. Overnight, it's dead for sure. It drains the battery, even when console is turned off.

I tried simulating different solutions I found online, but to no avail. I tried: 

\- Unplugging controller before turning off the console   
\- Not leaving the controller plugged in at night  
\- Leaving the controller plugged in at night  
\- Charging the controller through a wall charger  
\- Trying different cables (I read somewhere that non-official PS cables cause it to drain when plugged in)  
\- Leaving PS5 in rest mode overnight and empty controller plugged into the charger, both dead next day.

For many months my (now ex) girlfriend had ""game sharing and offline play"" enabled on her PS5 console through my account meaning she could download/play any of my games.

I would like to disable this gamesharing feature remotely, is it possible?? As I am not in a position to communicate with her 

I thought about using Sony's 'sign out on all devices' feature - essentially rendering my account useless on her PS5. Not sure if this would work though?? 

If that doesn't work, could I enable the gamesharing feature on another PS5 console and essentially force kick her PS5 from accessing my games (as I can only share with one PS5 at one time).

11anrau,Is my TV good enough for ps5?,"Sorry if this isnt the right sub to ask this.

Background: Stopped gaming for 5+ years, missed the ps4 generation, want to get back in gaming. Am not tech savy but am learning.

Growing up I had the ps3 and played BIG games like Skyrim, bioshock infinite, dishonored, uncharted series, The Last of us, Assassins creed series, borderlands 2, far cry 3.

I never used a HDMI cable when playing these games and just used the AV composite cable that came with the ps3. So that means I played all the games i mentioned at 480p when my TV is capable of 1080p.

I didnt know about HDMI cables when I was like 11-13 years old. But i recently started my ps3 up again and wondered why the games looked so blurry. I then finally used a HDMI cable for the first time and my games looked so much clearer. I have no idea how younger me played those games at that low of a resolution and didnt notice. Kinda hitting myself in the head for playing all those great games at that low quality.

The TV i used with the ps3 and the one I currently have is the: Samsung UN55D6000SFXZA from 2011

[https://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs/UN55D6000SFXZA-specs](https://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs/UN55D6000SFXZA-specs)

Based on my research this TV goes up to 1080p and has a Clear Motion Rate of 240.

I would be happy playing games at 1080p and 60FPS. is my TV capable of 60fps? Are most ps5 games 60fps?

Would 1080p be good enough to appreciate ps5 graphics? Do you really notice that big of a difference at 1440 or 4K?",Nahsor99912,0,7,29,266,1497,0,0

11aowxz,Blocked from Playstation Network for a week.,"I'm sure I was reported by this one kid, whom I put on his place. I was drifting around the lobby in Grand Theft Auto Online when suddenly a RC - Car approached me and blew up my car. Sure enough I took revenge, he was using dirty tactics calling me a noob for using MK2 against ghost, ewo, RC car and tank, MK2 explosive and fire rounds, I told him to go to the beach for a fair 1v1, he refused and kept trying to kill me in RC. Sure enough I killed him (15-2 I believe) after what my connection to the lobby got lost (who would have thought, right?)
 He texted me, saying that he raped my mother, killed my family and other insults to my name, friends and family. I wrote back to him, saying he sounded like a 14 year old at most, because he didn't write a single word correct and that he should read a thousand or more books, before coming at me.

This was my first time playing after coming home from a long month of hard work. I work in a tyre storage hall (basically loading and unloading car and truck tyres mostly by hand.
 Next thing I know: I got blocked for a week for replying to a kid, who didn't have the right discipline. So I educated and disciplined him, as his parents should do. I didn't use a single bad word, because I didn't want to get blocked, yet still they found a reason to block me, without even showing the exact reason. I want to say thank you to the workers of Playstation for not giving a single f# about logic and blocking my account, because I did, what his parents were supposed to do, before they bought him a playstation, for educating the youth of this world and for being a fair player, even though I get thrown insults at me. You're doing such a great job, I think my ass hair would do a better job.

What I wanted to ask is: Is there a way to get my account back earlier? I tried texting them - nothing. I tried finding out the exact reason - nothing. 

Or is it that they just don't give a f# about what is written - who gets to be reported first - gets blocked?

Did this happen to you and for how long did you get blocked?

A apologize for my bad english, I'm not a native speaker of this language, nor is it my second language. Take care.

11a2szf,Ps5 account sharing and remote play,"Hi everyone,

since a few years Im using the account sharing option with my friend. So my account is primary on his Ps5 and vice versa. 

Now I've found out that there is the remote play option to play games on the phone when you re not home, as long as the Ps5 is in energy saving mode.  


BUT I cannot find out how to connect.   
What would be the way to still share our game library with each other but also that I can play on business trips?  


Example: we've bought the the Hogwarts game, but if I understand it correct I would have to put my Account on my Ps5 as primary and then it would work for me to play it remote (I bought the game), but that would leave him without the possibility to play the game while I'm on my trip(s)?  


Is there something that I miss or is it more of an either or option here?

3. A remake can bring in new fans to a franchise and help create a demand for new games

11afnd7,"Sony/Bethesda quietly took my money and REFUSE to refund it, against their own policy language.","Let me start by saying, $13 is not that big of a deal, this is all about the principle of the subject. 

I purchased and payed for ONE MONTH of Fallout 1st on January 22nd. Not wanting to be charged for a 2nd month, I immediately went to my account subscriptions to cancel it. Except, my subscription wasn't there. Great, this makes sense, seeing as I only purchased a month, I'm not subscribed. 

As I learned today, I WAS subscribed to a re-occurring fallout first subscription. It was just discreetly hidden under the game and app services. You know, the page that lists every game you've ever downloaded. Hell, even PlayStation home is still buried in there! After spending some time digging I was able to finally unsubscribe. No big deal, accidental purchases happen all the time, surely Sony will refund me, right? Wrong again! 

After spending the better part of an hour on hold, I was finally greeted by someone who understood my frustration in trying to cancel the subscription. However, I was told it's against playstation policy to refund my 3rd party subscription service. After escalating it to a supervisor, I was told again and again, the same thing. Only to be sent an email after my conversation outlining the policy they were using to deny my refund. 

""you can change your mind and obtain a refund for your subscription or subscription upgrade within 14 days from the initial purchase date. After the first 14 days, you can cancel your subscription at any time so that your subscription will expire when your next payment is due, which will stop future payments, but you will not receive a refund for payments already made.

After investigating your request, we have identified that it is more than 14 days since you made your original purchase. As a result, you do not qualify for a refund under our Cancellation Policy.""   


Now this would make complete sense if I purchased a year subscription and decided 14+ days in that I wanted a refund. That, however, is not the case! I'm being denied a refund for a charge made yesterday! I am beyond frustrated with this experience. I'd just do a charge back to my card, but the purchase (all but 96 cents) was made with funds from a gift card.

119ozyq,Horizon Forbidden West: Too much of a good thing?,"Just a quick preface to say that this is just my opinion of the game and I'm not calling out anyone who enjoyed this game more than me, just wanted to share my experience.

&#x200B;

I loved the first Horizon game, so I was looking forward to the sequel, but after finishing it, I have this feeling that there is just too much ""game"" there, I found it overwhelming and hectic, all the mechanics at play. A bunch of new elemental types with their own status effects, the weapons with their different alt fire modes. Your outfit weaves and weapon coils and meals and buffs and debuffs. I felt like the game wanted you to approach combat encounters very specifically and deliberately to maximize efficiency, but there's just SO much to it. You use elemental weapons to cause a staggered state, after which the elemental weapons are useless and you have to switch to tear damage which doesn't cause impact damage but tear damage removes parts so that you can loot them, otherwise they get destroyed by impact damage. So I spend all this time trying to work out the rock-paper-scissors loop for a particular machine, while trying to pinpoint tiny parts that get lost in the design of the machine, which would be fine if it was a one-on-one encounter but almost all my encounters, I get swarmed by multiple machines each with their own specific weaknesses and parts.

&#x200B;

I know the first game had all this stuff going on too, but it just seemed more manageable then, so much more focused and streamlined, I don't remember ever feeling overwhelmed in the first one, but here it just seems there is so much to keep track of. The game places an emphasis on melee combat but isn't really built for it, as there are very long windup animations punished by very long staggered animations, coupled with no block or parry mechanic. There's resonance build ups and valor surges and timed combos to remember, and I feel like I'm spinning plates. Then there's the story, with dozens of characters with tons of dialogue. I ended up doing something I almost never do and just skipped every cutscene and conversation just to speed things up so I could actually finish the game in a reasonable amount of time.

&#x200B;

Thank goodness for the Accessibility options. I had to adjust a lot of things to make the game more tolerable. I've been gaming my whole life and tend to just leave most settings at default, including difficulty, but here I knocked everything down to easy or story difficulty just so each fight wasn't a drawn-out slog. I made focus last as long as possible and slow down as much as possible, things like that. In the first game, I played it very stealthily, scoping out a lone machine, then setting up multiple tripwires and then a cluster of bombs, then aggro-ing the machine to chase me into the huge trap I had built and taking them out instantly. Very satisfying gameplay loop. Here, I never really found that to be a viable tactic as they really limited the number of traps you could set up on the field and then making you trip your own traps if things get hectic and you accidentally run into them because your view is on the machines around you. Most machines have ranged attacks that would harmlessly trip all my traps before they ran into them anyway. It's ok that they designed the sequel to be played differently than the original, but I never got the sense that I was very good at the sequel's way of doing things. Every fight was a hectic spam of dodge rolls and healing as I whittled down the half dozen machines running amok hitting me with ranged damage and sweeping area attacks.

I'm no stranger to rpg's or big open world games with lots of mechanics but this is one of the few games I've really struggled to just remember and utilize everything that's there, to the point where it just felt bloated and too big for its own good, like it was overdesigned just for the sake of it. I will say, the art design is fantastic, especially as you get further west, and I think this series does have a unique world and concept that I find very engaging, and I just hope that future titles pare some things back and make different playstyles a little more approachable. I'd be curious to hear if others had a similar experience as me.",Accelerant_84,0,9,49,766,4262,0,0

119snmw,What is the best OLED TV/Monitor for PS5 under 48 inch ?,"Im looking to fit a smaller size OLED TV or Monitor, wouldn't bother me either, on my pc desk. What are my real options?

According to [Rtings.com](https://Rtings.com) there would be

LG C2 leading the way for TV's followed closely buy Sony A90K, both in 42"" sizes. For some reason i did not find any review on that website for Panasonic LZ1500 series which has also a 42"" panel and it is said to have very good picture quality/accuracy. 

Honestly an Sony A95K would be a no brainer to choose but that TV only comes in 55"" or bigger and i can't fit it in a small room. The viewing distance would be too small.

Unfortunately there isn't any QD-OLED for smaller sizes yet apart from PC monitors.

For monitors, the Alienware 32 DW and DWF are only 2K and doesn't fully support PS5/Xbox Series X features. As far as i know there is a newly released LG 27GR OLED monitor that fully supports all console features but it's also 2k and has a matte finish of which i m not too really fond of.

My picks would be from the first 3 TV's mentioned above. Help me out with a decision. If you know there's a better TV/Monitor that meets the criteria: under 48"", 4K resolution, 120hz, VRR, ALLM, Freesync, HDMI 2.1, at least 800 nits peak brightness HDR.

 I asked for at least 800 nits peak brightness because i already own an LG CX 55"" that does that and i want an upgrade not a downgrade.

Is there a protective film covering the lenses? I don't see anything and worried to try and remove something that isn't there and cause damage. 

1 ) I noticed a slight glare/blur/haze (mostly the bottom) which causes some words and images to look rough or washed out. This is noticeable with and without glasses.

2 ) I also noticed a very faint permanent artifact in the background of the vr projection. It reminds me of a softer version of tvs in the 90s. Is that normal? (First experience with vr) 

3 ) There are also a few very light swirls or scratches on both lenses. Like a few small squiggles or circles if you look at a certain angle.  Looks like water residue on oppos8te side of lens I can't seem to wipe away.

I had not touched them to cause any oil to contaminate screen or leave marks. I did open a new glasses microfiber cloth and lightly rub them but everything persists. 

It is bearable for gameplay but really noticeable when not in action like menus and stills. It looks really good otherwise.

While I do see the issues that have resulted in the game being judged harshly, and can understand why people dropped it pretty early on, or didn‘t even give it a shot at all, I find myself enjoying the fast-paced, deep action combat system that Platinum is known for, the collecting of loot, materials, blueprints and cosmetics as well as the fantasy setting, (admittedly badly executed but unique) artstyle and phenomenal music.

Of course, I don’t expect there to be a game that is exactly the same, but if there are things that just hit some of the points I‘ve mentioned, I would gladly try them out.

It's time to upgrade from my firecuda 530 1tb
I want to just stay with firecuda and get the 2 tb but I have a question that I need answered that I cannot find anywhere on the internet... or maybe I'm asking it wrong.
The loading speed is great and everything and seems to be thee ONLY THING that is ever discussed.. but I would like to bring something up concerning the graphical difference between the ssd standard with the PS5 and the one you buy to install for more space.  Maybe it's just me... but does anyone see a drop in fidelity when it comes to the reflections ... lighting and textures.

I've tested 

Cyberpunk
Hogwarts
Modern Warfare 2 (campaign)
Dead Space 
Dying Light 2
GOW Ragnarok
Yakuza like a dragon

There is a significant difference when playing on an SSD

T.V. is an LG 48"" C1 (OLED)
Just for an idea on the picture quality that I can see. Does anyone have ANY info on this... and which M.2 SSD is the closest to reaching the performance (graphically).

This is our first time owning a PS3 (We own a ps4 for over 7 years now but he wanted his own console). (It make us appreciate the audio port on the PS4 controller even more). If we can't fix it this way can you recommend some other solution or other adapters/converters? Thanks for your answers.

119gyhb,What the heck is Enhance thinking with charging for Rez and Tetris Effect's PS5 upgrades?!,"It'd be one thing if both of them had some extra content to warrant the ten dollar upgrade like with Death Stranding, but outside of PSVR 2 support, there's literally nothing else that warrants having to pay extra to access them at all if we've purchased them already! 

In the case of Rez Infinite, all they're really having current owners pay extra for is the ability to play the game with freakin' HDR turned on. HDR!! That's something that was a part of Tetris Effect from day freaking one when that was just on PS4 only!  And it's seemingly the only thing that the many of us that don't have the headset are getting here. Heck, they couldn't even be bothered to give players any 120 FPS support at all for either this or on Tetris Effect.

And speaking of Tetris Effect, THAT BS is even more of a slap in the face to current owners as well as instead of giving people a paid upgrade path, which is ridiculous in itself even when that was announced, they give players NO upgrade path for that! And I looked on the PS5 Store and the app; there's none to speak of. I'm willing to give them a benefit of the doubt that it's something of an error or whatever, but even so, that at least had more content added to it close to the headset's release! And all that was FREE! Again, something the upgrades themselves should be! And they have no excuse to do that either seeing as they've been capable of doing just that when they brought the game over to Xbox!

It doesn't matter how much anyone would try to justify this, and frankly I don't know how anyone would with this one. It's still stupidly greedy, even for Enhance themselves!",JustCallMeTsukasa-96,0,15,90,303,1631,0,0

Failing that, can I link this card to multiple Sony Rewards accounts at once? Or maybe there's a workaround so I can still use the points to my current PSN account's benefit?

I apparently have 45 gb left which is basically nothing if I want a good game. It says on the screen “Free space: 45.80 gb” to be exact. But above it says “Size: 667.2 gb”. Does this mean that the total storage for my console is only 667.2 gb?? I specifically remember when I bought it at Walmart it said on the box 825 gb storage. I did the math and added up how much storage I am taking from the games and apps and all other stuff. I am approx taking up 621.53 gb, but my system says I only have 45 gb left. But if I only have that much left then that would put me at a capacity of about 668 gb in total for my console! I’ve had this console since December and I barely checked the storage today. Anybody correct if I am wrong about this, but I think I was lied to? I don’t think I was really given 825gb of storage when it clearly said so on the box. I am kind of frustrated as I wanted to get some more games, Is there anything I can do about this?? Any suggestions would be much appreciated, Thank You.

I have a PS4, which at this current time can play most modern games and still has a frequently updated catalog. However, I've noticed that I'm quite content with simply playing the single player games I have, and not really paying any attention to the online modes they come with despite the option being available. I bought PS plus because I thought that I wanted to play online, but most online games are pretty barren now unfortunately, (GTA V is slowly dying, Red Dead redemption has already died, some older call of duty games still have a player base but only on the team deathmatch game modes.) 

In general I'm just not having alot of fun on the online game modes. Except for free to play games like Apex legends, Fortnite, etc. I don't know why that is, I just find single player open worlds to be much more interesting and even thrilling at times. Perhaps it's just my subjective experience, but at this point I don't think I'm going to resubscribe to PS plus since I haven't really noticed any benifet from it apart from having specific online modes, and discounts available.",Pokechu2876,0,9,48,212,1204,0,0

118ondm,Guide: How to Address the High Noise Floor of the PS5 Headphone Jack,"Due to some sort of engineering oversight, the headphone jack of the PS5 Duelsense Controller has a very noticeable hiss and hum from a high noise floor. So can you fix it? No.

Okay guide over, please up-vote and share!

But in all seriousness, you cannot fix the problem but you *can* address it. Before I do, let me explain what is going on for those who do not understand what a noise floor is.

The insides of the PS5 controller have been improperly shielded and so the game sound is receiving interference from the controller's insides. It is called a noise floor because it is the floor that your wanted signal is going to have to be louder than to be heard. As the noise floor is interfering with your signal at the controller, lowering or raising the volume will not affect the volume of the hiss.

Consider the following (the decibel scale is no as easy as just using percentages, but let us just assume it is for the sake of simplicity):

1. Game sound from your console -- let us say you have set it to ***30% volume***.
2. Game sound is sent to your controller.
3. The controller's noise floor affects your signal -- for the sake of easy number, let us say it takes up ***10%*** of the signal.
4. By the time the signal hits your ears, it is still ***30%***, but now it is ***20% game sound***, ***10% his and hum*** \-- 2:1 ratio.

How about a better option:

1. Game sound form your console -- set to ***100% volume***.
2. Game sound is sent to your controller.
3. The controller's noise floor affects your signal -- for the sake of easy number, let us say it takes up ***10%*** of the signal.
4. This ***100%*** signal would consist of ***90% game sound***, ***10% his and hum***.
5. Instead of your (head/ear)phones being plugged directly into your controller, have them plugged into a cable that has volume control.
6. Cable volume control is set down to ***30% volume***.
7. By the time the signal hits your ears, it is ***27% game sound***, ***3% his and hum*** \-- 9:1 ratio.

These cables are not expensive at all and can be bought from Ebay/Amazon/Aliexpress/Electrical stores. Search for a volume cable, or cable with an in-line attenuator. Just make sure that if your headset has a microphone that you get a TRRS cable that also supports it. The flip-side is also true: if your (head/ear)phones do not have a microphone, make sure that the cable does not have one otherwise the microphone on your controller will not function. You will also want to look for something with a physical knob or wheel, not one that has buttons.

118o97f,Marvel's Spider-Man ending got me,"Just finished this for the first time and I was not expecting the ending to be so emotional. I recently got a PS5 and I've been working through a bunch of Plus games, prioritizing ones that have sequels coming out soon or recently released. This wasn't high on my list, because I'd heard mixed reviews about the gameplay and repetitive side quests. The only really great thing I'd heard about it was the NYC setting and photo mode. The last Spider-Man game I played was on the GameCube, and I remembered having fun, but it wasn't amazing. In general though, I'm a fan of the comics and movies.

All this to say, I went in with middling-low expectations and I was absolutely not prepared to love this version of Peter Parker and be so wrecked by May's passing. I've seen Aunt May die so many times at this point, I didn't think it would phase me, but they really set it up for the highest emotional impact by making Peter choose to let her go almost immediately after losing his role model (Ock's betrayal and manipulative monologue hurt more than expected as well). I've rarely heard praise for the storyline of this game, but it was a really solid Spider-Man story, not just a game. 

Also, not so much story-related, but they really nailed the little things. The collectibles were great, taking pictures was fun, and even the fast travel animations on the subway were entertaining. Just sharing some praise. Going to start Miles Morales next!",LopeyO,0,5,33,256,1444,0,0

1195cky,I'd like to ask the North American and European people's perception of Last of Us 2 and Neil Druckman.," Hello, I am a gamer who uses PlayStation 5 in Korea. Please understand that I use a translator.  
I started playing video games on PlayStation 5 around July 2021, and now I have about 120 games in my library. In addition to God of War 4, Ragnarok, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Ghost of Tsushima, Biohazard 2, 3, 7, 8, Horizon Zero Dawn, forbidden West, Uncharted 4. I have played numerous masterpiece third-party games and Jrpg. If you ask me to choose the last game I can play before I die, I will say Last of Us 2 without hesitation. I also played last of us 1 in ps4 version and last of us 1 remake in ps5 version. I know there was a lot of controversy when Last of Us 2 was released, and three years after its launch, in Korea, people still criticize people who think Last of Us 2 is fun. 

1. The way Joel was killed.  
2. Political correctness, PC  
3. A chapter to play as Abby Anderson who killed Joel.  
Nevertheless, I really enjoyed Last of Us 2 and the story and gameplay were the best. Three years after its release, I wonder how Last of Us 2 and Neil Druckman are evaluated in North America and Europe. Worst game and director?

My wifi is far from ideal, but my mobile hotspot easily does all the heavy lifting of my actual online gaming. My hotspot data is limited monthly so I exclusively will update my games overnight on wifi and save my hotspot for playing. 

Each time I intend to play online where I want my best connection, I will go in and pause every active game update so that my limited hotspot won’t be wasted as I hop into whatever. However it seems like several times per week, without fail, my PS5 turns around and says “okay but how about no” and resumes ALL those downloads without any kind of notice or manual resume by me which I don’t have the slightest clue about until I get off my game and see I’ve had 5GB out of my monthly 20 just dust away to nothing.

Sure, I could turn off automatic updates and solve THIS issue altogether, but then I don’t even get notified a game has an update at all until I launch it..then I’m out of luck anyways because I have to wait on the wifi to download that when it could have downloaded this entire past week.

Sorry for formatting (on mobile) or spelling errors (English is not my native language). 

I am having some issues with my new PS5 and Playstation is being completely unhelpfull.

I bought my console last week. It works, however whenever I start any PS5 game, I get the error code CE 108255-1. I tried all the solutions suggested by playstation and online (reinstalling games, safe mode/reconstructing database, checking for updates, resetting console, changing HDMI, changing language and various settings, etc), however nothing fixes the problem.

When I call playstation support, they just give me a link to the solutions on their FAQ page.
When I tell them this does not solve the issue, they say I should contact the supplier (Playstation Direct).

Playstation Direct is unreachable (I live in Belgium and they are only available via chat, which never puts you through to an agent and simply disconnects after waiting for more than an hour.

Does anyone have a solution or a way to contact Playstation Direct via mail or phone (Belgium)?

I'm going to start off by saying I'm someone who thoroughly enjoyed both Spiderman and Miles Morales and like others, looking forward to the sequel. But what I don't understand is the immense hype behind it. I know for sure it's going to be fun what could possibly be different from the first 2 games? I don't see how they could make the swinging (which I believe is the most fun part) better in the sequel. What makes the game a ""Guaranteed GOTY"" in the eyes of so many people?

118w645,Do disc games always copy themselves onto your PS5's hard drive? I thought we could save hard drive space by using a disc?,"Hi. I am slowly running out of hard drive space on my PS5, I am down to 170 GB of hard drive space. So I bought the PS4 Gundam Versus disc version, thinking that I could save some space on my hard drive if I use the disc version (I owned a PS1 and PS2, and I could play any game off a disc on the PS1 and PS2). However, I just popped the Gundam Versus disc into my PS5, and it copied some 13 GB to my hard drive anyways.

Is that normal, that disc games usually copy themselves onto the PS5 hard drive anyways? I didn't even get an option to not copy Gundam Versus on my PS5's disc, it copied itself automatically when I tried to play it. If that's the case, I don't see any difference between the disc version and digital version, if they both occupy the same space on your hard drive.",hk_bob,0,23,122,158,786,0,0

But now I want a bigger screen. I play on the PS4 and Nintendo switch, mostly single player, no fps, non-competitive games. Like P5R, god of war, horizon, nier, pokemon etc.

I will start my residency in 6 months, and since PS5 is out of stock(again) and I don’t wanna buy a 120fps TV yet because of the residency and work and busy, etc, should I buy a TV or a monitor? 

Also, I was thinking when I do eventually buy a 120fps tv for ps5, I will put the TV/monitor whatever I buy in my parents’ extra bedroom lol, so any thoughts?

118h4ov,Mic echo/feedback in Warzone,"I’m using a wired headset plugged into the controller and my friends keep hearing gunfire and explosions echoing from me. My audio output is my headset, my tv speakers are off. I’ve tried a few different wired headsets and I keep having the same issue. Currently using a Turtle Beach Recon 200.

I’ve googled and looked up this issue and tried all of the following:

Increase mic threshold in game to 100 (max)
Decrease mic volume in game to <6
Decrease mic volume in the ps5 menu to zero (all the way left)
Decrease the audio volume to roughly 70%

I can get the echo to stop but my mic sounds really low to my friends and hard to hear. We are using Warzone in game voice since some are using Xbox. If I increase the mic volume then all the gunfire and background noise is heard again. I also don’t like having to lower my audio because hearing footsteps is important to my gameplay. 

I found one relevant Reddit thread from two years ago and further down in the comments it seems some people blame this issue on wired headsets and claim the wireless ones don’t have this echo issue.

Does anyone know if this is true still? Has anyone else run into this issue, specifically with Warzone? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I hate that this impacts my friends and our ability to have fun as a squad. Thanks in advance",Cloudy621,0,4,28,244,1323,0,0

It always happens in one specific direction : when I slightly move the joystick to the left, or when I slowly rotate the joystick in a clockwise circle, but the other directions like up, down, right are perfectly fluid and don't have this problem at all

Is it because the controller is new and need some wear maybe ? If this doesn't goes away with time, can I fix this ?

My PS5 just stopped being able to read any discs. It has worked fine since last June. The last time I played a disc, there was an almost grinding/crunchy sound. The game played fine though and was able to eject afterwards like normal. 

I have tried the safe mode steps of resetting, but I haven’t done the factory reset. If I do that, do I lose digital games progress? 

Is there anything else I should try to fix it or does it need repaired by Sony? I don’t know of any warranty I might have. I tried both calling and chatting with PS support but neither helped; I couldn’t even connect to them. I have the console standing vertically if that’s a concern.

That got me thinking about how it might be fun to imagine having your favourite game(s) cross over into a different design/genre. Something some studios have already done on their own: e.g. Darksiders Genesis compared to the other entries in the series.

Here are some of my fantasies (with some gameplay element ideas. I realise I’m not being “original” here, just copying existing gameplay but filling it with the imagery and characters from others, but that’s exactly what I wanna hear from you 😁)
 
1) A God of War JRPG 
(Compare to: Battlechasers/Ruined King)

Mana = Rage
Kratos- Actions: Axe throw (single opponent medium damage), Blade Swipe (multiple opponent low damage), Spear Jab (extra stun damage) , Guard Shield- Abilities: Ivaldi’s Anvil (AOE damage and frost), Frost Giant Fury, Fury of the Ice Troll, Tartarus Rage, Hyperion Grapple, Cyclone of Chaos. Spear Slices (single enemy damage) Thousand Spears (damage to several enemies at random), Valour Heal - Burst: Rock throw, Spartan Flurry (multiple barehand punches finishing with a Spartan Kick), Glaive Storm (High damage to all opponents)

2) Castlevania Open world RPG
(Compare to: Witcher/Darksiders)

An open world Transylvania in the time of Vlad “Dracula” Tepes. - Travel by on foot, by horse, boat, transmission mirror,… and find and fight vampires, night creatures, ghouls, necromancers, etc. - Big cities, small villages, tombs, ruins,… - Form alliances by clearing away monster nests near towns, fulfilling requests or tasks.- Arsenal of weapons, mainly the chain whip, short sword, crossbow,…- Unlock (magical) abilities which provide access to new areas

3)Ghost of Tsushima 2D action stealth adventure platformer (Mark of the Ninja)

- Choose the honour in your path: Challenge your enemies as a Samurai, Spread terror as the Ghost, or sneak past all enemies and only eliminate your exact target.- Traversal Gear: Grappling hook- Samurai Gear: Katana, Heavy Armour, Longbow, Medicinal Pouch- Ghost Gear: Katana, Stealth Gear, Poison darts, Smoke Bomb, Short Bow

11890w9,PS5 keeps crashing a lot on certain games. Please help.,"I got my ps5 around 1.5yrs ago at this point, bought from a certified Sony retailer at MSRP\*.   


Please note, whenever I say ""crashed"" I mean the screen either blacks out or freezes, the machine sometimes makes a weird teeny sound, and then powers off, to power it on again, I need to click on the power button of the machine twice. 

Straight after buying it, I played Spiderman Miles Morales, and it froze and crashed during the starting cutscene. This problem persisted and kept getting worse, sometimes crashing twice in 40mins, so I took it to the customer service outlet in my city, to get it checked and possibly replaced. Long story short, they played the same game and could not recreate the problem on their end, on my machine. Hence, they did not replace my machine. After that, I brought it home again and decided to switch the plug it was attached in, thinking maybe the plug has some defect that's messing up power delivery? Sure enough, the crashes either stopped or became less frequent.   
After some time, I forgot about the issue, and it only ever happened maybe 5 times since then. I've noticed it mainly happens during the graphically intensive games. I play a lot of FIFA sometimes, and it's never crashed during that. It crashed maybe once playing Horizon FW, maybe twice playing Elden Ring. But all those crashes were so infrequent, I decided not to worry about them as I couldnt do much about it.   


Fast forward to yesterday, I bought God Of War Ragnarok and tried playing it. It was riddled with crashes, from what I can remember, it has crashed 10+ times in what is 4hrs of total playtime with the game so far. Most times it's in cutscenes, sometimes it's on the freaking pause menu. I'm fed up at this point as I lose some progress each time. For GOW, the crash is a sudden freezing of the game, then a dark green screen, after which the machines turns off. I'm out my wits end with this. I talked to the seller today about it, and he said that the problem may be with my TV (wtf?) stating it may not support the framerates, which is insane because then why would the whole system shut off and not the TV itself or just the game. My TV is the LG OLED G1 just for reference, and the issue was still there in an older Sony TV.  


So what do I do here? what is really the issue do you think? Is it the power delivery issue I think it is? Is it really a TV problem? It's so hard to diagnose as the crash only happens in certain games, and differs from game to game. It's also hard to recreate the problem on command ofc. The seller did offer me to bring my machine to his store, and play it there just to see what happens and try to recreate it. He also offered to replace it for 20-30% of the cost of the machine if it was a defective console (as it's out of warranty).  


The text on the box was Russian/Eastern European in places, if that tells you anything. I'm in India, but my house has universal plugs and the machine came with a native power plug and not a foreign one, I think.

k1j96e,"Don't give in. Boycott scalpers. They are feeling it, and it's getting to them.","This is working. I'm seeing on my facebook local marketplace the price of PS5's coming down. A week ago, everything was in the 800-1000. Now I'm consistently seeing prices in the $600-700 range. But I'm not going to buy.  Guys--there aren't that many games out. There is NO reason to buy in just yet. These guys are going to get screwed, and they KNOW it. Scalpers are tossing and turning ""Do I return it? Do I hold out? What if they restock?"" **Make their lives hell.** DONT BUY--there is light at the end of the tunnel and we are starting to wear them down.

**Follow up to a few comments here and there:**\-------------------------------------------------------------------------1)""But dude--capitalism? Supply & Demand? Free Market?""  
""Supply and demand"" applies when consumers have an even playing field and equal access to the goods. Scalpers now use bots to cheat the line. They are literally stealing the supply to make the demand *appear* high. That's like being in an auction house, but your mouth is taped shut by scalpers who get the first and last bid thanks to a bot. Who thinks that's fair and should be legal?

2) You should get a bot.  
Bots are the problem here. 99% of scalpers are not writing their own scripts. They're buying them from 'legitimate' companies and it's totally legal! But that doesn't change the fact that they are profiting by allowing scalpers to cheat the line. Sounds pretty scummy to me. Why is the bar for everything these days based on legality? What happened to..I dunno..don't be a shithead? (/s).

3) Prices are still high around me...and I really need it for X / Y / Z reasons.  
Take the money you would have spent and subtract 500 from it. Think hard about what *else* you could buy and *still have enough left over for a PS5*. Was it meant to be a gift? I'll tell you what's a better gift--COLD HARD CASH.

And last but not least, to the scalpers commenting, you are in fact thieves. The legality is not the issue here.**You're a thief.** Keep laughing and enjoying your cash--I don't care. You didn't earn that profit. You stole it. You're not a ""hustler"", you're a grifter. Stop lying to yourself.",Bk050,0,14,79,374,2150,0,0

It’s now 4:30PM, and there are a 12 people here. We are all waiting in our cars parked right in front of the store. 

So the 13th guy shows up, I explain to him we all have agreed to wait in cars and respect the order so we don’t have to lineup outside (it’s cold AF). This guy then says, “Nope! Ya gotta be lined up”. He then takes a chair and races to the store’s entrance and sits down. He then starts chanting, “IM FIRST!!”. I roll my eyes but don’t care b/c I’ll still get a PS5.

The guy then realizes he left his credit card at home and frantically runs to me (sitting in my car) and asks me to save his spot in line. 

I reply, “No can do bro, I’m not even in line”

The guy realizing how badly he screwed up jumps in his car and races home. Unlikely he’ll make it back in time. Karma is so sweet.",uncle_stonkey,0,10,61,193,940,0,0
