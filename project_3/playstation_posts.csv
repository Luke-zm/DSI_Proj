s6yq3l,PlayStation studios this morning,
ixehwx,What goes around comes around,
y5fapb,I absolutely hate seeing this when I turn on my $500 gaming machine.,
jg8v3d,Best employee time off request I’ve ever received 😂🤣,
v2aele,"My son, best gamer I know, a Sony fan. Gaming got him thru battle with leukemia. He passed away on 19th last month.",
jju368,"Game time everyone, just arrived at the warehouse",
rdcral,"today at work, scalper tried buying 13, only one per customer, refunded him his money, he wasn’t happy caught, the scumbag💪🏻",
zbvole,I wanted to disguise my son’s birthday present. It’s a PS5,
ld9vv4,Both of these games are Fire,
ga7n6q,should have waited a bit longer,
k168hg,Sony just announced that the PS5 launch was their biggest console launch ever! Just sucks that the majority of PS5’s are boxed on eBay. Lol,
urocl8,This is a Fact!,
jrqqxj,Somebody loves me! PS5 bundle came early!,
juy11s,This dude is speaking facts about the PS5 scalpers And exposes the scalpers,
k1j96e,"Don't give in. Boycott scalpers. They are feeling it, and it's getting to them.","This is working. I'm seeing on my facebook local marketplace the price of PS5's coming down. A week ago, everything was in the 800-1000. Now I'm consistently seeing prices in the $600-700 range. But I'm not going to buy.  Guys--there aren't that many games out. There is NO reason to buy in just yet. These guys are going to get screwed, and they KNOW it. Scalpers are tossing and turning ""Do I return it? Do I hold out? What if they restock?"" **Make their lives hell.** DONT BUY--there is light at the end of the tunnel and we are starting to wear them down.

**Follow up to a few comments here and there:**\-------------------------------------------------------------------------1)""But dude--capitalism? Supply & Demand? Free Market?""  
""Supply and demand"" applies when consumers have an even playing field and equal access to the goods. Scalpers now use bots to cheat the line. They are literally stealing the supply to make the demand *appear* high. That's like being in an auction house, but your mouth is taped shut by scalpers who get the first and last bid thanks to a bot. Who thinks that's fair and should be legal?

2) You should get a bot.  
Bots are the problem here. 99% of scalpers are not writing their own scripts. They're buying them from 'legitimate' companies and it's totally legal! But that doesn't change the fact that they are profiting by allowing scalpers to cheat the line. Sounds pretty scummy to me. Why is the bar for everything these days based on legality? What happened to..I dunno..don't be a shithead? (/s).

3) Prices are still high around me...and I really need it for X / Y / Z reasons.  
Take the money you would have spent and subtract 500 from it. Think hard about what *else* you could buy and *still have enough left over for a PS5*. Was it meant to be a gift? I'll tell you what's a better gift--COLD HARD CASH.

And last but not least, to the scalpers commenting, you are in fact thieves. The legality is not the issue here.**You're a thief.** Keep laughing and enjoying your cash--I don't care. You didn't earn that profit. You stole it. You're not a ""hustler"", you're a grifter. Stop lying to yourself."

It’s now 4:30PM, and there are a 12 people here. We are all waiting in our cars parked right in front of the store. 

So the 13th guy shows up, I explain to him we all have agreed to wait in cars and respect the order so we don’t have to lineup outside (it’s cold AF). This guy then says, “Nope! Ya gotta be lined up”. He then takes a chair and races to the store’s entrance and sits down. He then starts chanting, “IM FIRST!!”. I roll my eyes but don’t care b/c I’ll still get a PS5.

The guy then realizes he left his credit card at home and frantically runs to me (sitting in my car) and asks me to save his spot in line. 

I reply, “No can do bro, I’m not even in line”

The guy realizing how badly he screwed up jumps in his car and races home. Unlikely he’ll make it back in time. Karma is so sweet."

11c88ry,"When I was younger, I was on PlayStation Home and did something worthy of a scolding.","When I was younger I was on PlayStation Home and made a decision that I know was terrible in hindsight. 

PlayStation Home was certainly something. A social hub with a variety of games to play. My favorite was called - if I remember correctly - Salt 2. It was a racing game with speeders, and for some reason the first iteration of the game was a mech-style shooter. There were also crappy dance parties, cringy flirting, have house/apartment, and probably a lot of unsavory stuff (like A/S/L crap). This kind of game was in at the time. Like a less cartoony version of Free Realms. For anybody who is unfamiliar, these games were about creating an online persona through an avatar pre-2010. 

One of the things people liked to do was share accounts...

You'd meet someone, talk about games, and somebody says, ""Hey, how about we trade passwords and download each other's games?"" Or they come right out of the gate, and the typical strategy when this happened was stall. Scammers get frustrated, people just looking to score don't try too hard. This happened to me and I stupidly said yes. 

Fortunately for me nothing happened. The account info they gave was legit and I was able to download the first Infamous (loved that game). 

Looking back, I cannot believe I was so stupid. I got lucky.

I am still too trusting, something my girlfriend likes to point out. There was this one time I was helping out a homeless man. I didn't have any cash with me, so I let him GET IN MY CAR AND WE DROVE TO THE BANK. I was an actual adult at the time, I have no excuse. But I don't give out my passwords. By God, I would never do anything so foolish.

Hi, All

I have just had my PS5 delivered today but as soon as I got it booted up I realised I had a huge problem. My PSN account is over 10 years old, linked to an old email account and I don't know the password anymore :(

So as anyone would I went to the website to see what troubleshooting options there were that might help me. There weren't any. I tried every single old password I could remember and used their online assistant (completely useless btw) and tweeted the askplaystation twitter and tried to unlock this ancient gmail account which has probably been deleted or something and still got absolutely nowhere. You might be thinking; ""Wouldn't you just make a new account?"" and yes I would but I have over 100 PS4 games in my library for this account, some of which I haven't even played yet.A few years ago I threw out my PS4, see my last PlayStation post for context, and I thought I would be done with them for good but the exclusives on PS5 really sucked me in this year.

But none of that is even the worst part, I was getting desperate and impatient at having a fancy bit of tech sitting there that I can't play a single game on apart from Astro playground. I tried to get one of those Twitter ""Account recovery"" accounts to do some magic and find a way into this account to reset it. And then I got scammed. I feel too much shame to say how much money I sent them. It was enough to seem reasonable but not too much to throw up the redflags straight away.

I'm an idiot, how could I be so gullible? I don't know and trust me I'm not gonna fall for that one again.

Now can anyone give me any advice on how to get this account back or at the very least some communication with playstation?"

11c4x7i,Controllers disconnecting and not charging,"So I have a ps4 slim I’ve had for a few years now. I take good care of it and it isn’t dusty or dirty. I’ve recently had issues with my External drive and headset disconnecting, which made me think I have a port issue. Now it’s my controller but it’s ridiculous. Between my 3 controllers, none of them charge for more than a few seconds and then disconnect every few minutes. I can turn them on and connect them but they constantly stop charging and disconnect. I’ve changed connection type (usb/BT), I’ve tried resetting every controller, I’ve tried different controller charging cords or methods of charging, and rebuilding database, and I’m on thin edge lol. Anyone have any suggestions on this issue i’ve been suffering with for weeks?"

Things seemed blurry and fuzzy and I was seeing a lot of halo effects on pretty much anything bright.  When I used a flashlight to get the right angle I was able to see a bunch of stains and smudges on the lenses.  They do not come off with a microfiber and might even be on the other side of the lens.  Here are pictures of the more prominent smudges.  There are rings on both of them (I only included one) and there is a weird grid pattern on the other.

11bygjv,Why does the joystick on all my new controllers always feel so rusty and not lubricated ?,"Everytime I get a new dualsense controller, the left joystick is always perfect, very fluid with no problems, but the right joystick when I move it slowly in one direction always feels like moving a rusty wheels or something, like a grain of sand was stuck inside it, i feel a resistance like it's not lubricated enough, and it makes creaking noises

I always have to play games where you move the right joystick ( usually the camera )  around a lot with the new controller for at least 5/6 days before this feeling in the left joystick goes away, and it starts moving around in a fluid way, it's really strange 

Why does this happen only on the left joystick for every new controller I've got ? And why does using the controller for a couple of days seems to fix the issue ?"

Photo of error: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zZZaLfKrgE7xsK-SBHlk55hfpjTbizNJ

11c8kji,PlayStation 6 and my personal feeling.,"Hello everyone. I've been doing a good amount of research on recent technology that was released and or mentioned in late 2022 to early 2023. From what I've seen so far I would like to make a guess here and say that I think that it's possible that the PlayStation 6 might use all Intel parts inside.

One of the reasons I say this is because Intel's recent attempt to try their hand at the discrete GPU market. Seems like even low power versions of their ARC architecture are seen in the foreseeable future as well. Because of this, I personally feel that Intel will try to undercut AMD and make Sony an offer they can't refuse because Intel themselves are technically the underdog in the GPU segment.

I can see them using a newer 14th gen i7/i9 laptop low power CPU and a custom ARC GPU based on their ""Druid"" architecture. In this case it would be a combination of the two to make a hybrid or in this case SoC (System on a Chip). 

It's about gaining market share and what better way to do that then making custom SoCs for the best console brand in the world. Plus, Intel's color scheme does fit the PlayStation like a glove."

I am thinking of buying a thing for GTA (money from a modder or something) the thing is that they require 2 or 3 backup codes? 

Is it safe to give them 3 codes because I can remove and readd or change the 2 factor authentication method which generates new codes and the old ones wouldn't work? 

I can also change the email and password and sign out of all devices then readd the authentication.

Will the account be safe and secure after this whole GTA stuff is done?"

11bu827,Day 1 PlayStation 5 WiFi issue,"Hello everyone, I have one of the PlayStation 5s from release day. I don't know if that matters but I had an issue with one of my video games. For some reason it God of War Ragnarok didn't upload version 2 of it's update and skipped to Version 3(Maybe I didn't play it for a while) and that Version 2 update was giving me an error message and downloads and I couldn't get rid of it. So I decided to fully reset the PS5

Now that I've reset it, the WI-FI has not been working correctly since. I even reset it again and that didn't fix it. Everytime I turn on the PS5 I have to go into settings to connect the WiFi, I just toggle it on and off and then it will connect but even then, I'm trying to use the Funimation app and it doesn't work. The PlayStation doesn't add some photo's of titles. I've never had an issue with my WiFi until I reset it and no I can't use an Ethernet cable, even if I could. I would still want the problem resolved. I literally have a PC on the other wall of my room connected to WiFi and I have no issues.

Has anyone experienced this?"
11bu1m4,Is this sound normal?,"Hi, I bought my PS5 a year ago and since then played some not-really demanding games (mostly games from PS4 that do not have a PS5 version). Recently I started playing Horizon Forbidden West which I think is one of the most demanding PS5 games made to this date and started to notice some severe coil whine coming from my console. I know that it's normal, it gets worse when something is happening and gets better when I'm in the game's main menu (looking at the map etc.). However, what concerns me is the fact that once it starts, it doesn't really end until I turn the game off completely. It is audible even in the console's home screen (very faint buzzing).   
I know, that this issue (coil whine) has been addressed a lot on this subreddit, but I just have to make sure, that there is nothing bad happening to my console."

11bre42,Playstation 4 randomly shuts down...,"need help with ps4 fat.... bought a defective console which shuts down randomly, sometimes you can game for hours. sometimes it shuts down instantly, and if it shuts down, it's completely dead unless you disconnect the power cord out, and in again. I've come to the conclusion that the system is perfectly fine, I managed to fresh install the software cause it was a hacked version of it. At startup it's blue as usual, and goes white and into the system....is the power supply at fault? Wouldn't imagine the apu problem since it boots perfectly but shuts down randomly. I've added washers trick to ensure, but didn't fix. I don't have a power supply at hand damn it... Have one with 4 pin connector and mine is 5.... Any suggestions?"

●tried ""restore default settings""
●tried ""rebuild database""
●tried downloading the (((update))) system software file (NOT the entire console system file) in BOTH WAYS 1-using a USB drive 2-downloading the update from the internet while in Safe Mode

I love the pulse headset but after 2 to 3 hour gaming sessions, my ears begin to hurt. So I did my research to find a good alternative and I heard a lot of good things about the arctis nova 7p. I bought one yesterday and man was I blown away with the audio quality and comfort! It doesn't have the tight clamping force that the pulse 3d had on my head. It's worth the extra $60. I was supposed to get the 7P plus but I found more pros with the Nova 7P. The 38-hr battery life and bluetooth connectivity is amazing and works very seamlessly. I recommend anyone who's looking for a decent headset to get the Steelseries Arctis Nova 7P, you won't regret it! 

*I still give a slight edge to the Pulse on audio quality as to me it sounds a bit better, it sounds more whole and intact, oh and the bass is better. But talking about comfort (which to me matters more), it's night and day with the arctis. Lots of people hate on the Arctis but it's not that bad, y'all just complain too much lol."

the router is less than a foot away from the console so signal strength is not a problem.

But over the past couple days, my triggers started to feel really strange whenever I would press them down. I figured the issue was the springs. So being really careful with my R2, I sprayed just a tiny bit of WD-40. I didn't need to take the controller apart, just a small amount fixed the issue, and it was great! However, the same thing started to happen to my L2, I did the same thing, and after a few minutes of playing, my L2 just stopped responding completely. Before anyone asks, yes I pressed the reset button on the back of the controller, and it still wasn't responding. So, I wanted to ask before I attempt to open up my controller, what should I look out for after opening it? Does anybody know what could potentially be the problem? I really don't want to spend the money to fix it if I can do it myself and I don't wanna buy a new one if I don't have to. Thanks for any assistance, and feel free to think I'm an idiot.

11ao0dk,Controller battery dies overnight/after turning off console,"It might've been asked a million times, but out of all articles/reddit posts, I couldn't seem to find an answer that actually helps me solve the problem. So I have a PS5 and 2 controllers (official ones). When I bought my PS5, I got an Qware charging station as a freebie. So I plugged in, all was fun and games. 

After a while, I started noticing that one controller in the docking station wasn't charging when the console was on. No biggie, cause I got two and it eventually charged. A few weeks later, I started noticing that my other controller also wasn't charging anymore when in the dock. Okay, got rid of the dock, and went for good ol' cabled charging. Didn't change. My controllers do charge when plugged in, but they empty out quite fast after turning off the console. So when I play for a couple of hours, controller is fully charged, turn it off, but when I get back to playing a few hours later, it's almost dead. Overnight, it's dead for sure. It drains the battery, even when console is turned off.

I tried simulating different solutions I found online, but to no avail. I tried: 

\- Unplugging controller before turning off the console   
\- Not leaving the controller plugged in at night  
\- Leaving the controller plugged in at night  
\- Charging the controller through a wall charger  
\- Trying different cables (I read somewhere that non-official PS cables cause it to drain when plugged in)  
\- Leaving PS5 in rest mode overnight and empty controller plugged into the charger, both dead next day.  


Whatever I try, it always ends up empty when I start to game. So, beautiful people of Reddit. How can I finally get back to gaming with charged controllers?"
11arwyk,I sympathize with Abby,"I just completed The Last of Us Part II and though Abby killed Joel in the first chapter, later when got to know her story I realise she went through a rough life: Dad got killed, her friends got killed, and lost everything she worked for within WLF and later tortured by the Rattlers.

I wanted Ellie to leave her and not kill her in the last fight.

Abby did kill Joel (beloved character) but what would anyone do, Joel killed her father.

I may receive hate but the game was everything I hoped for in a sequel.

Peace!"

For many months my (now ex) girlfriend had ""game sharing and offline play"" enabled on her PS5 console through my account meaning she could download/play any of my games.

I would like to disable this gamesharing feature remotely, is it possible?? As I am not in a position to communicate with her 

I thought about using Sony's 'sign out on all devices' feature - essentially rendering my account useless on her PS5. Not sure if this would work though?? 

If that doesn't work, could I enable the gamesharing feature on another PS5 console and essentially force kick her PS5 from accessing my games (as I can only share with one PS5 at one time).

Guys
I sent my PlayStation 5 in a year ago and got it replaced. I also opened up a second repair accidentally and well it remained open till today.
I was happy with the replacement they gave me and everything works properly but last week I received an email that my repaired product has left their storage.
I thought it was a bug and didn’t think much of it.
Nevertheless I still looked it up and it was the second repair case I opened up a year ago which is still on the status that I need to
Send the PS5 in.
Yesterday a replacement Ps5 arrived at my home lol.
I was shocked.
I directly tried it out and of course I will sell it.
Sadly I noticed that the Ps5 has problems and it shuts off by itself sometimes and freezes.
Is it safe to send it in now or would they keep it in their storage when I send it in for repair as I seriously want to atleast gain some profit out of my luck."

11anrau,Is my TV good enough for ps5?,"Sorry if this isnt the right sub to ask this.

Background: Stopped gaming for 5+ years, missed the ps4 generation, want to get back in gaming. Am not tech savy but am learning.

Growing up I had the ps3 and played BIG games like Skyrim, bioshock infinite, dishonored, uncharted series, The Last of us, Assassins creed series, borderlands 2, far cry 3.

I never used a HDMI cable when playing these games and just used the AV composite cable that came with the ps3. So that means I played all the games i mentioned at 480p when my TV is capable of 1080p.

I didnt know about HDMI cables when I was like 11-13 years old. But i recently started my ps3 up again and wondered why the games looked so blurry. I then finally used a HDMI cable for the first time and my games looked so much clearer. I have no idea how younger me played those games at that low of a resolution and didnt notice. Kinda hitting myself in the head for playing all those great games at that low quality.

The TV i used with the ps3 and the one I currently have is the: Samsung UN55D6000SFXZA from 2011

[https://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs/UN55D6000SFXZA-specs](https://www.samsung.com/us/video/tvs/UN55D6000SFXZA-specs)

Based on my research this TV goes up to 1080p and has a Clear Motion Rate of 240.

I would be happy playing games at 1080p and 60FPS. is my TV capable of 60fps? Are most ps5 games 60fps?

Would 1080p be good enough to appreciate ps5 graphics? Do you really notice that big of a difference at 1440 or 4K?"

EDIT: **Can you play VR or digital movies on the PSVR2, and how would you go about doing that?

Context: I've had VR in the past (Oculus Rift with motion controllers and turrets), but rarely used it because of setup annoyances.

This video is a fascinating example of how gaming is evolving with these advanced technology , and it's definitely worth watching : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuVxPg4GLk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKuVxPg4GLk)

I am enrolled in the advanced protection program, so it requires either a physical security key (which is not compatible with the PS5 browser) or security code. When I generate the code in my PC or mobile device, it is not accepted on the PS5.

11abaq0,Someone's downloading free DLC on my account,"Hi there.  I think I know how this whole thing got started.  I sold a PSTV and I may have forgotten to wipe my profile from it.  I noticed about two weeks later a bunch of free Vita DLC being downloaded as I was getting the email receipts.

Checked my PSN account.  There was an extra Vita on it that I didn't recognize.  I figure it must be the PSTV, yeah?

I change my password, I disassociate ALL my devices, and sign out of them all.  I have had two-factor authorization for a while now.  I signed back into my PS5, but that's it.

Today, out of the blue, another download receipt in my inbox.  Again, for 0.00, but still...

Downloaded Borderlands 3 for free on PlayStation Plus and when I look at what version it is, it says Ultimate Edition, which includes all the DLC from the past two seasons.

However, when I play the game those extra features such as Mayhem Mode aren't there and also when I go to the store the option to buy the DLC or season passes are there (doesn't say I already own them).

Also, it won't allow me to buy the Ultimate Edition because it says I have it, but again, I don't have the DLC that's included with the Ultimate Edition.

11aowxz,Blocked from Playstation Network for a week.,"I'm sure I was reported by this one kid, whom I put on his place. I was drifting around the lobby in Grand Theft Auto Online when suddenly a RC - Car approached me and blew up my car. Sure enough I took revenge, he was using dirty tactics calling me a noob for using MK2 against ghost, ewo, RC car and tank, MK2 explosive and fire rounds, I told him to go to the beach for a fair 1v1, he refused and kept trying to kill me in RC. Sure enough I killed him (15-2 I believe) after what my connection to the lobby got lost (who would have thought, right?)
 He texted me, saying that he raped my mother, killed my family and other insults to my name, friends and family. I wrote back to him, saying he sounded like a 14 year old at most, because he didn't write a single word correct and that he should read a thousand or more books, before coming at me.

This was my first time playing after coming home from a long month of hard work. I work in a tyre storage hall (basically loading and unloading car and truck tyres mostly by hand.
 Next thing I know: I got blocked for a week for replying to a kid, who didn't have the right discipline. So I educated and disciplined him, as his parents should do. I didn't use a single bad word, because I didn't want to get blocked, yet still they found a reason to block me, without even showing the exact reason. I want to say thank you to the workers of Playstation for not giving a single f# about logic and blocking my account, because I did, what his parents were supposed to do, before they bought him a playstation, for educating the youth of this world and for being a fair player, even though I get thrown insults at me. You're doing such a great job, I think my ass hair would do a better job.

What I wanted to ask is: Is there a way to get my account back earlier? I tried texting them - nothing. I tried finding out the exact reason - nothing. 

Or is it that they just don't give a f# about what is written - who gets to be reported first - gets blocked?

Did this happen to you and for how long did you get blocked?

11a8h0j,Playing The Last of Us 2 on PS5 when owning PS4 disc version,"Ok, so I have 6 TB of stuff on my PS4, which is split up into external HDD and internal memory. My external is 4 TB and I have the majority of the games I still play on that thing. If I want to play a PS4 game on my PS5, I have to connect my external to my HDD and insert the disc into the system. It's tedious because when I reconnect my external to my PS4, it takes FOREVER to fully read the external. I'm afraid something can go wrong during that process so I want to minimize the disconnecting/reconnecting of the external.

I want to play TLOU 2 on my PS5 because it has the 60 fps mode, but again, having to go through the external HDD thing, it's not ideal. I was thinking of just straight up buying the digital version on my PS5. It's on sale for under $10, but what will happen to the disc version that is used on my PS4? Do I have to delete that version and only play the digital version? Can I have both the digital versions installed on the PS4 and PS5 at the same time or do I have to keep connecting the external HDD to whatever system I want to use at that moment?

since a few years Im using the account sharing option with my friend. So my account is primary on his Ps5 and vice versa.

BUT I cannot find out how to connect.   
What would be the way to still share our game library with each other but also that I can play on business trips?  


Example: we've bought the the Hogwarts game, but if I understand it correct I would have to put my Account on my Ps5 as primary and then it would work for me to play it remote (I bought the game), but that would leave him without the possibility to play the game while I'm on my trip(s)?

1. Hardcore gamers underestimate how much of a turn off older mechanics and graphics are to casual gamers
2. Remaking a game can be artistically fulfilling for developers 
3. A remake can bring in new fans to a franchise and help create a demand for new games
4. What makes a game “sufficiently outdated” is completely subjective 

You certainly can make an argument that remakes prevent new IPs from being produced but that is a separate argument. I am only talking about full remakes not remasters."

11afnd7,"Sony/Bethesda quietly took my money and REFUSE to refund it, against their own policy language.","Let me start by saying, $13 is not that big of a deal, this is all about the principle of the subject. 

I purchased and payed for ONE MONTH of Fallout 1st on January 22nd. Not wanting to be charged for a 2nd month, I immediately went to my account subscriptions to cancel it. Except, my subscription wasn't there. Great, this makes sense, seeing as I only purchased a month, I'm not subscribed. 

As I learned today, I WAS subscribed to a re-occurring fallout first subscription. It was just discreetly hidden under the game and app services. You know, the page that lists every game you've ever downloaded. Hell, even PlayStation home is still buried in there! After spending some time digging I was able to finally unsubscribe. No big deal, accidental purchases happen all the time, surely Sony will refund me, right? Wrong again! 

After spending the better part of an hour on hold, I was finally greeted by someone who understood my frustration in trying to cancel the subscription. However, I was told it's against playstation policy to refund my 3rd party subscription service. After escalating it to a supervisor, I was told again and again, the same thing. Only to be sent an email after my conversation outlining the policy they were using to deny my refund. 

""you can change your mind and obtain a refund for your subscription or subscription upgrade within 14 days from the initial purchase date. After the first 14 days, you can cancel your subscription at any time so that your subscription will expire when your next payment is due, which will stop future payments, but you will not receive a refund for payments already made.

After investigating your request, we have identified that it is more than 14 days since you made your original purchase. As a result, you do not qualify for a refund under our Cancellation Policy.""

Don't know where else to ask.,"I just received a refund to my PayPal (verified everything already, it is indeed a refund for my purchase, not an outright payment) for my pre-purchase of Jedi: Survivor. Only problem is, I didn't request a refund, and the PlayStation purchase history doesn't show a refund. Other occurrence of interest, I went to the PlayStation mobile app to check if I still owned the game, and while it doesn't seem like I own the deluxe edition anymore, there was a third version it said I DID  own beyond the standard and deluxe, with an option to install to my PS5. It just loads indefinitely if I try. Anyone have any idea what is going with this?"

I'm sorry if this is a completely dumb question, but this is my first Playstation. When I turn on the machine, the disc makes a lot of noise. Sort of like a hard drive or a CD rom from a computer from 20 years ago. 

That is annoying, but the bigger problem is that it doesn't seem to accept any discs. It's not a digital edition. It has a slot for discs. But they don't seem to go in. It's brand new. There is nothing stuck in there already.

Am I doing something really dumb or is possible I have a broken machine out of the box?"

I immediately talked to playstation support, they said they would refund it, this time only. I saved the messages. 

Then I got an email yesterday that they would not be refunding anything.

119ozyq,Horizon Forbidden West: Too much of a good thing?,"Just a quick preface to say that this is just my opinion of the game and I'm not calling out anyone who enjoyed this game more than me, just wanted to share my experience.

&#x200B;

I loved the first Horizon game, so I was looking forward to the sequel, but after finishing it, I have this feeling that there is just too much ""game"" there, I found it overwhelming and hectic, all the mechanics at play. A bunch of new elemental types with their own status effects, the weapons with their different alt fire modes. Your outfit weaves and weapon coils and meals and buffs and debuffs. I felt like the game wanted you to approach combat encounters very specifically and deliberately to maximize efficiency, but there's just SO much to it. You use elemental weapons to cause a staggered state, after which the elemental weapons are useless and you have to switch to tear damage which doesn't cause impact damage but tear damage removes parts so that you can loot them, otherwise they get destroyed by impact damage. So I spend all this time trying to work out the rock-paper-scissors loop for a particular machine, while trying to pinpoint tiny parts that get lost in the design of the machine, which would be fine if it was a one-on-one encounter but almost all my encounters, I get swarmed by multiple machines each with their own specific weaknesses and parts.

&#x200B;

I know the first game had all this stuff going on too, but it just seemed more manageable then, so much more focused and streamlined, I don't remember ever feeling overwhelmed in the first one, but here it just seems there is so much to keep track of. The game places an emphasis on melee combat but isn't really built for it, as there are very long windup animations punished by very long staggered animations, coupled with no block or parry mechanic. There's resonance build ups and valor surges and timed combos to remember, and I feel like I'm spinning plates. Then there's the story, with dozens of characters with tons of dialogue. I ended up doing something I almost never do and just skipped every cutscene and conversation just to speed things up so I could actually finish the game in a reasonable amount of time.

&#x200B;

Thank goodness for the Accessibility options. I had to adjust a lot of things to make the game more tolerable. I've been gaming my whole life and tend to just leave most settings at default, including difficulty, but here I knocked everything down to easy or story difficulty just so each fight wasn't a drawn-out slog. I made focus last as long as possible and slow down as much as possible, things like that. In the first game, I played it very stealthily, scoping out a lone machine, then setting up multiple tripwires and then a cluster of bombs, then aggro-ing the machine to chase me into the huge trap I had built and taking them out instantly. Very satisfying gameplay loop. Here, I never really found that to be a viable tactic as they really limited the number of traps you could set up on the field and then making you trip your own traps if things get hectic and you accidentally run into them because your view is on the machines around you. Most machines have ranged attacks that would harmlessly trip all my traps before they ran into them anyway. It's ok that they designed the sequel to be played differently than the original, but I never got the sense that I was very good at the sequel's way of doing things. Every fight was a hectic spam of dodge rolls and healing as I whittled down the half dozen machines running amok hitting me with ranged damage and sweeping area attacks.

&#x200B;

I'm no stranger to rpg's or big open world games with lots of mechanics but this is one of the few games I've really struggled to just remember and utilize everything that's there, to the point where it just felt bloated and too big for its own good, like it was overdesigned just for the sake of it. I will say, the art design is fantastic, especially as you get further west, and I think this series does have a unique world and concept that I find very engaging, and I just hope that future titles pare some things back and make different playstyles a little more approachable. I'd be curious to hear if others had a similar experience as me."

According to [Rtings.com](https://Rtings.com) there would be

LG C2 leading the way for TV's followed closely buy Sony A90K, both in 42"" sizes. For some reason i did not find any review on that website for Panasonic LZ1500 series which has also a 42"" panel and it is said to have very good picture quality/accuracy. 

Honestly an Sony A95K would be a no brainer to choose but that TV only comes in 55"" or bigger and i can't fit it in a small room. The viewing distance would be too small.

Unfortunately there isn't any QD-OLED for smaller sizes yet apart from PC monitors.

For monitors, the Alienware 32 DW and DWF are only 2K and doesn't fully support PS5/Xbox Series X features. As far as i know there is a newly released LG 27GR OLED monitor that fully supports all console features but it's also 2k and has a matte finish of which i m not too really fond of.

My picks would be from the first 3 TV's mentioned above. Help me out with a decision. If you know there's a better TV/Monitor that meets the criteria: under 48"", 4K resolution, 120hz, VRR, ALLM, Freesync, HDMI 2.1, at least 800 nits peak brightness HDR.

 I asked for at least 800 nits peak brightness because i already own an LG CX 55"" that does that and i want an upgrade not a downgrade.

Thank you!"

Is there a protective film covering the lenses? I don't see anything and worried to try and remove something that isn't there and cause damage. 

1 ) I noticed a slight glare/blur/haze (mostly the bottom) which causes some words and images to look rough or washed out. This is noticeable with and without glasses.

2 ) I also noticed a very faint permanent artifact in the background of the vr projection. It reminds me of a softer version of tvs in the 90s. Is that normal? (First experience with vr) 

3 ) There are also a few very light swirls or scratches on both lenses. Like a few small squiggles or circles if you look at a certain angle.  Looks like water residue on oppos8te side of lens I can't seem to wipe away.

I had not touched them to cause any oil to contaminate screen or leave marks. I did open a new glasses microfiber cloth and lightly rub them but everything persists. 

It is bearable for gameplay but really noticeable when not in action like menus and stills. It looks really good otherwise. 

Could you tell me if 1-3 are normal. Thanks"

119ensg,Hi so my freinds can’t hear my voice in their clips and I have all the setting turned on any help ?,Ps5
119ea15,Games like Babylon‘s Fall?,"Heya! I’ve been playing Babylon‘s Fall for a video I‘m working on these past few days and, to my surprise, I‘m enjoying it quite a lot. Enough to be sad to see it become unplayable in a few days, and it makes me want to look for something similar that I can get into long-term.
While I do see the issues that have resulted in the game being judged harshly, and can understand why people dropped it pretty early on, or didn‘t even give it a shot at all, I find myself enjoying the fast-paced, deep action combat system that Platinum is known for, the collecting of loot, materials, blueprints and cosmetics as well as the fantasy setting, (admittedly badly executed but unique) artstyle and phenomenal music.

Of course, I don’t expect there to be a game that is exactly the same, but if there are things that just hit some of the points I‘ve mentioned, I would gladly try them out. Bonus points for the game having an active player base, because that‘s something Babylon‘s Fall is (obviously) missing heavily. 

Thanks for your help! :)"

Update
Upon first restarting ps5, it'll say too many usb devices connected...two bubbles saying that. There's only the headset plugged in. Then after I unplug it and replug it it doesn't say it again and doesn't connect either. No lights in, no power to headset.
My other concern was there was two sets of Sony authentication stickers on top of each other as if it had been sealed, opened, then resealed. The power blipped on for a second but immediately looked like it shorted out. My concern is I have a faulty unit but no one at Playstation to talk to since they just shut off voice calls for support"

119hg0p,can I use my ps4 controler without the battery while still pluged in the ps4?,"Years ago, I took appart a ps4 controler, but broke the battery ribbon cable

I removed the battery and it still worked when pluged in the ps4

To make things short, the micro usb of the controler broke, so I opend the controler to see what model the micro usb adapter is, so I know what to order

I saw the battery had a bulge, so I desposed of it safely

I was checking online to see if the ps4 controler would work without the battery, but only being connected to the ps4

Even if I knew it worked and I tested it, I still wanted to search and see

I sae people say how no, it will not work

So I'm confused, does it work or does it not?

Maybe it's just specific models of the controler that can work without the battery?"

The loading speed is great and everything and seems to be thee ONLY THING that is ever discussed.. but I would like to bring something up concerning the graphical difference between the ssd standard with the PS5 and the one you buy to install for more space.  Maybe it's just me... but does anyone see a drop in fidelity when it comes to the reflections ... lighting and textures.

I've tested 

Cyberpunk
Hogwarts
Modern Warfare 2 (campaign)
Dead Space 
Dying Light 2
GOW Ragnarok
Yakuza like a dragon

There is a significant difference when playing on an SSD

119gyhb,What the heck is Enhance thinking with charging for Rez and Tetris Effect's PS5 upgrades?!,"It'd be one thing if both of them had some extra content to warrant the ten dollar upgrade like with Death Stranding, but outside of PSVR 2 support, there's literally nothing else that warrants having to pay extra to access them at all if we've purchased them already! 

In the case of Rez Infinite, all they're really having current owners pay extra for is the ability to play the game with freakin' HDR turned on. HDR!! That's something that was a part of Tetris Effect from day freaking one when that was just on PS4 only!  And it's seemingly the only thing that the many of us that don't have the headset are getting here. Heck, they couldn't even be bothered to give players any 120 FPS support at all for either this or on Tetris Effect.

And speaking of Tetris Effect, THAT BS is even more of a slap in the face to current owners as well as instead of giving people a paid upgrade path, which is ridiculous in itself even when that was announced, they give players NO upgrade path for that! And I looked on the PS5 Store and the app; there's none to speak of. I'm willing to give them a benefit of the doubt that it's something of an error or whatever, but even so, that at least had more content added to it close to the headset's release! And all that was FREE! Again, something the upgrades themselves should be! And they have no excuse to do that either seeing as they've been capable of doing just that when they brought the game over to Xbox!

It doesn't matter how much anyone would try to justify this, and frankly I don't know how anyone would with this one. It's still stupidly greedy, even for Enhance themselves!"

119ec6p,Unlinking A Playstation Visa Card From Sony Rewards,"So recently I applied to the Playstation Visa Card, and I got approved. The problem is, I made the mistake of using the wrong email when applying to it (stupid autofill and me not paying attention...), so it's currently linked a Sony Rewards account attached to my old PSN from when I was a kid.

There is no apparent way to delink my card from the Sony Rewards website, so I was wondering if, when I do get my card in the mail, I'll be able to delink my card and move it over to my current Sony Rewards account from the card account page?

Failing that, can I link this card to multiple Sony Rewards accounts at once? Or maybe there's a workaround so I can still use the points to my current PSN account's benefit?

Side question: where am I supposed to receive the temporary card number for digital purchases that the website mentioned I should get after approval? I would assume a text, but I'm not sure."

I apparently have 45 gb left which is basically nothing if I want a good game. It says on the screen “Free space: 45.80 gb” to be exact. But above it says “Size: 667.2 gb”. Does this mean that the total storage for my console is only 667.2 gb?? I specifically remember when I bought it at Walmart it said on the box 825 gb storage. I did the math and added up how much storage I am taking from the games and apps and all other stuff. I am approx taking up 621.53 gb, but my system says I only have 45 gb left. But if I only have that much left then that would put me at a capacity of about 668 gb in total for my console! I’ve had this console since December and I barely checked the storage today. Anybody correct if I am wrong about this, but I think I was lied to? I don’t think I was really given 825gb of storage when it clearly said so on the box. I am kind of frustrated as I wanted to get some more games, Is there anything I can do about this?? Any suggestions would be much appreciated, Thank You.

Was messing around with some rings but at the lower level they are useless just get stuck. I like the sticks at the higher level.

119sq9q,PlayStation plus is losing it's value to me now.,"So basically, I've been noticing how I've been lacking any real point in continuing to subscribe to PlayStation plus. I have a PS4, which at this current time can play most modern games and still has a frequently updated catalog. However, I've noticed that I'm quite content with simply playing the single player games I have, and not really paying any attention to the online modes they come with despite the option being available. I bought PS plus because I thought that I wanted to play online, but most online games are pretty barren now unfortunately, (GTA V is slowly dying, Red Dead redemption has already died, some older call of duty games still have a player base but only on the team deathmatch game modes.) 

In general I'm just not having alot of fun on the online game modes. Except for free to play games like Apex legends, Fortnite, etc. I don't know why that is, I just find single player open worlds to be much more interesting and even thrilling at times. Perhaps it's just my subjective experience, but at this point I don't think I'm going to resubscribe to PS plus since I haven't really noticed any benifet from it apart from having specific online modes, and discounts available."

This came out 10+ years ago and damn I miss it sometimes. If you have not seen it before, it was an assault rifle frame that had 2 pockets to snap both move controllers onto and you essentially was able to aim and shoot with the assault rifle. I didn’t feel at a disadvantage at all in the game and felt evenly matched with those on controller. 

In addition, PlayStation had so many cool features that many game developers never took advantage of. It seems mainly the PlayStation exclusive games would utilize features such as the six-axis. I remember knifing players on Call of Duty 3 by literally knifing the air with my controller. I also remember the Sony TV, where instead of playing split screen, it was a polarized tv that had both screens layered on top of eachother; player 1 would grab their glasses and player 2 would grab their glasses, each able to see their specific screen. Any other cool things you guys miss?"
118ondm,Guide: How to Address the High Noise Floor of the PS5 Headphone Jack,"Due to some sort of engineering oversight, the headphone jack of the PS5 Duelsense Controller has a very noticeable hiss and hum from a high noise floor. So can you fix it? No.

Okay guide over, please up-vote and share!

But in all seriousness, you cannot fix the problem but you *can* address it. Before I do, let me explain what is going on for those who do not understand what a noise floor is.

The insides of the PS5 controller have been improperly shielded and so the game sound is receiving interference from the controller's insides. It is called a noise floor because it is the floor that your wanted signal is going to have to be louder than to be heard. As the noise floor is interfering with your signal at the controller, lowering or raising the volume will not affect the volume of the hiss.

Consider the following (the decibel scale is no as easy as just using percentages, but let us just assume it is for the sake of simplicity):

1. Game sound from your console -- let us say you have set it to ***30% volume***.
2. Game sound is sent to your controller.
3. The controller's noise floor affects your signal -- for the sake of easy number, let us say it takes up ***10%*** of the signal.
4. By the time the signal hits your ears, it is still ***30%***, but now it is ***20% game sound***, ***10% his and hum*** \-- 2:1 ratio.

How about a better option:

1. Game sound form your console -- set to ***100% volume***.
2. Game sound is sent to your controller.
3. The controller's noise floor affects your signal -- for the sake of easy number, let us say it takes up ***10%*** of the signal.
4. This ***100%*** signal would consist of ***90% game sound***, ***10% his and hum***.
5. Instead of your (head/ear)phones being plugged directly into your controller, have them plugged into a cable that has volume control.
6. Cable volume control is set down to ***30% volume***.
7. By the time the signal hits your ears, it is ***27% game sound***, ***3% his and hum*** \-- 9:1 ratio.

These cables are not expensive at all and can be bought from Ebay/Amazon/Aliexpress/Electrical stores. Search for a volume cable, or cable with an in-line attenuator. Just make sure that if your headset has a microphone that you get a TRRS cable that also supports it. The flip-side is also true: if your (head/ear)phones do not have a microphone, make sure that the cable does not have one otherwise the microphone on your controller will not function. You will also want to look for something with a physical knob or wheel, not one that has buttons.

The only way for you to correct it temporarily is manually cutting the controller on/off.

Prior to the game, it does it 100% of the time for GTA 5 online when trying to acces/change the weapons wheel.

Online chat service can't connect to someone and there's no phone number. All Sony number, Noone. After 3 days, finally connected. Nice guy, nothing wrong with him, tells me he can only refund the first purchase for $23. Tell me because the game was downloaded I can't refund the ultimate edition. I ask him if I can go to my bank have them do it. He says yes but that will ban my account. So the money I use to buy the games on that account is just gone if I do that? That's stupid.

118o97f,Marvel's Spider-Man ending got me,"Just finished this for the first time and I was not expecting the ending to be so emotional. I recently got a PS5 and I've been working through a bunch of Plus games, prioritizing ones that have sequels coming out soon or recently released. This wasn't high on my list, because I'd heard mixed reviews about the gameplay and repetitive side quests. The only really great thing I'd heard about it was the NYC setting and photo mode. The last Spider-Man game I played was on the GameCube, and I remembered having fun, but it wasn't amazing. In general though, I'm a fan of the comics and movies.

All this to say, I went in with middling-low expectations and I was absolutely not prepared to love this version of Peter Parker and be so wrecked by May's passing. I've seen Aunt May die so many times at this point, I didn't think it would phase me, but they really set it up for the highest emotional impact by making Peter choose to let her go almost immediately after losing his role model (Ock's betrayal and manipulative monologue hurt more than expected as well). I've rarely heard praise for the storyline of this game, but it was a really solid Spider-Man story, not just a game. 

Also, not so much story-related, but they really nailed the little things. The collectibles were great, taking pictures was fun, and even the fast travel animations on the subway were entertaining. Just sharing some praise. Going to start Miles Morales next!"

1195cky,I'd like to ask the North American and European people's perception of Last of Us 2 and Neil Druckman.," Hello, I am a gamer who uses PlayStation 5 in Korea. Please understand that I use a translator.  
I started playing video games on PlayStation 5 around July 2021, and now I have about 120 games in my library. In addition to God of War 4, Ragnarok, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Ghost of Tsushima, Biohazard 2, 3, 7, 8, Horizon Zero Dawn, forbidden West, Uncharted 4. I have played numerous masterpiece third-party games and Jrpg. If you ask me to choose the last game I can play before I die, I will say Last of Us 2 without hesitation. I also played last of us 1 in ps4 version and last of us 1 remake in ps5 version. I know there was a lot of controversy when Last of Us 2 was released, and three years after its launch, in Korea, people still criticize people who think Last of Us 2 is fun. 

1. The way Joel was killed.  
2. Political correctness, PC  
3. A chapter to play as Abby Anderson who killed Joel.  
Nevertheless, I really enjoyed Last of Us 2 and the story and gameplay were the best. Three years after its release, I wonder how Last of Us 2 and Neil Druckman are evaluated in North America and Europe. Worst game and director? Or are they the best game and director?"

118w33s,“Pausing” Updates,"This is gonna read a lot more like just venting, but it’s become such a pattern I wanna yell about it. There aren’t words to describe how frustrating updating games on PS5 seems to be at times. 

My wifi is far from ideal, but my mobile hotspot easily does all the heavy lifting of my actual online gaming. My hotspot data is limited monthly so I exclusively will update my games overnight on wifi and save my hotspot for playing. 

Each time I intend to play online where I want my best connection, I will go in and pause every active game update so that my limited hotspot won’t be wasted as I hop into whatever. However it seems like several times per week, without fail, my PS5 turns around and says “okay but how about no” and resumes ALL those downloads without any kind of notice or manual resume by me which I don’t have the slightest clue about until I get off my game and see I’ve had 5GB out of my monthly 20 just dust away to nothing.

Sure, I could turn off automatic updates and solve THIS issue altogether, but then I don’t even get notified a game has an update at all until I launch it..then I’m out of luck anyways because I have to wait on the wifi to download that when it could have downloaded this entire past week. Sincerely, all I’m asking for is that when I select “Pause”… that hoe stays paused until I click on resume myself. Not 20 minutes into the most soul crushing game of DBD or Overwatch to ever be."
118vxo2,Issue with Playstation (PS5),"Hi all! 

Sorry for formatting (on mobile) or spelling errors (English is not my native language). 

I am having some issues with my new PS5 and Playstation is being completely unhelpfull.

I bought my console last week. It works, however whenever I start any PS5 game, I get the error code CE 108255-1. I tried all the solutions suggested by playstation and online (reinstalling games, safe mode/reconstructing database, checking for updates, resetting console, changing HDMI, changing language and various settings, etc), however nothing fixes the problem.

When I call playstation support, they just give me a link to the solutions on their FAQ page.
When I tell them this does not solve the issue, they say I should contact the supplier (Playstation Direct).

Playstation Direct is unreachable (I live in Belgium and they are only available via chat, which never puts you through to an agent and simply disconnects after waiting for more than an hour.

Does anyone have a solution or a way to contact Playstation Direct via mail or phone (Belgium)?

I am really disappointed in PS because of this experience tbh. I also don't dare to send the PS back, because if it gets lost, I will not be able to contact them to get my money back and I will be left without a PS5 (even though it's quite useless atm).

But what I don't understand is the immense hype behind it. I know for sure it's going to be fun what could possibly be different from the first 2 games?

118w645,Do disc games always copy themselves onto your PS5's hard drive? I thought we could save hard drive space by using a disc?,"Hi. I am slowly running out of hard drive space on my PS5, I am down to 170 GB of hard drive space. So I bought the PS4 Gundam Versus disc version, thinking that I could save some space on my hard drive if I use the disc version (I owned a PS1 and PS2, and I could play any game off a disc on the PS1 and PS2). However, I just popped the Gundam Versus disc into my PS5, and it copied some 13 GB to my hard drive anyways.

Is that normal, that disc games usually copy themselves onto the PS5 hard drive anyways? I didn't even get an option to not copy Gundam Versus on my PS5's disc, it copied itself automatically when I tried to play it. If that's the case, I don't see any difference between the disc version and digital version, if they both occupy the same space on your hard drive."

Also, I was thinking when I do eventually buy a 120fps tv for ps5, I will put the TV/monitor whatever I buy in my parents’ extra bedroom lol, so any thoughts?

Thanks!"

I've tried using the support chat and calling. Obviously, they were closed over the weekend, that's fine, but today when I called during operating hours I was told by the automated system that they're experiencing unusually high call volume and to call back later. 

The thing is I can't really find anybody else complaining about this issue on the internet. So where's the high call volume coming from? How do I regain access to my account? I'm so confused.

118hyeh,Voucher code keeps being declined,"I have **purchased** two different 75$ voucher codes, one from bestbuy, the other from wallmart, and have attempted to use them with my PSN account.

When I use them however, it starts to go through and says ""Confirm Redemption: $75.00"" and then when i hit accept, it says ""The voucher code is incorrect or is no longer valid"". This happens on both cards. I **have both numbers correct** and the website acknowledges it. I have attempted to do this both through the PS3 store and on my PC web browser.

I honestly i have no idea what to do. The whole reason why i had to resort to buying vouchers was because PSN (for some reason) won't accept my debit card or paypal anymore either.

118h4ov,Mic echo/feedback in Warzone,"I’m using a wired headset plugged into the controller and my friends keep hearing gunfire and explosions echoing from me. My audio output is my headset, my tv speakers are off. I’ve tried a few different wired headsets and I keep having the same issue. Currently using a Turtle Beach Recon 200.

I’ve googled and looked up this issue and tried all of the following:

Increase mic threshold in game to 100 (max)
Decrease mic volume in game to <6
Decrease mic volume in the ps5 menu to zero (all the way left)
Decrease the audio volume to roughly 70%

I can get the echo to stop but my mic sounds really low to my friends and hard to hear. We are using Warzone in game voice since some are using Xbox. If I increase the mic volume then all the gunfire and background noise is heard again. I also don’t like having to lower my audio because hearing footsteps is important to my gameplay. 

I found one relevant Reddit thread from two years ago and further down in the comments it seems some people blame this issue on wired headsets and claim the wireless ones don’t have this echo issue.

Does anyone know if this is true still? Has anyone else run into this issue, specifically with Warzone? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I hate that this impacts my friends and our ability to have fun as a squad. Thanks in advance"

It always happens in one specific direction : when I slightly move the joystick to the left, or when I slowly rotate the joystick in a clockwise circle, but the other directions like up, down, right are perfectly fluid and don't have this problem at all

Is it because the controller is new and need some wear maybe ? If this doesn't goes away with time, can I fix this ?

118df9r,PS5 suddenly not reading any disc,"PS5 suddenly not reading any disc

My PS5 just stopped being able to read any discs. It has worked fine since last June. The last time I played a disc, there was an almost grinding/crunchy sound. The game played fine though and was able to eject afterwards like normal. 

I have tried the safe mode steps of resetting, but I haven’t done the factory reset. If I do that, do I lose digital games progress? 

Is there anything else I should try to fix it or does it need repaired by Sony? I don’t know of any warranty I might have. I tried both calling and chatting with PS support but neither helped; I couldn’t even connect to them. I have the console standing vertically if that’s a concern.
