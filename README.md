# Analysis of Singapore monthly weather on PV Generation

---

### Problem Statement

> * Singapore is trying to decarbonize the electrical grid. Solar energy plays a major role in this initiative. Unfortunately, solar energy can be intermittent, due to cloud coverage and rainfall. Therefore, this project aims to analyse trends in Singapore weather to identify if rainny seasons in Singapore adversely affect the generation of energy using photovoltaic (PV) panels. This analysis can then help stakeholders, such as PV system owners, decide if they need to include other sources of energy.
