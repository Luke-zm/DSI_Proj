# Analysis of Singapore monthly weather on PV Generation

> * Singapore is trying to decarbonize the electrical grid. In doing so, renewable energy source such as solar energy is choosen. However, solar energy can be intermittent due to cloud coverage and rainfall. This project aims to analyse trends in Singapore weather to identify if the rainny season in Singapore adversely affect the generation of energy using photovoltaic panels. This analysis can then help stakeholders decide if they would want to use other sources of energy.
